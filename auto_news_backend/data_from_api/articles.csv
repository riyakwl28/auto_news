"New Delhi: The disruption that Covid-19 has brought about will trigger a boom in the market for Internet of Things , or connected technologies, say industry executives and analysts. They add that companies such as Infosys , Tata Communications, ThoughtWorks, Citius Tech and Hero Electronics are betting on these opportunities. IoT has always existed as an automation tool but this disruption will enhance adoption of IoT just like it did for collaborative virtual meeting platforms,” said Alok Bhardiya, head ( IoT Business Unit ), Tata Communications.First, there was a dip. “The cellular-based IoT market is expected to have a YoY decline of 4.4% by end of CY2020,” said Apalak Ghosh, industry manager for digital transformation at market research and analysis firm Frost & Sullivan. He, however, expects the market to start reviving from 2021 and post as much as 22% growth the following year.Restaurants may have to attest to food quality in real time, said Selvakumar Natesan, the lead IoT tech consultant at ThoughtWorks. That should create a market for portable food sample analysers that give instant reports.Automatic disinfectants as well as air quality and cleanliness indicators would be needed in hotels, gyms and movie halls. Municipalities may also start deploying smart meters.Technology could be leveraged for remote monitoring, preventing failure of critical equipment, and disease prediction and diagnosis, said Sridhar Turaga, CitiusTech’s senior vice president for data science. There will likely be higher demand for wearable health devices and air quality and blood oxygen monitors.“There is an expectation that a digital health passport will become mandatory for train and public transportation,” ThoughtWork’s Natesan said.Automation will be crucial for scaling production up and down according to short term demand fluctuations and also for adaptive manufacturing — for instance when ventilators are manufactured at an automobile plant, said Ravi Aggarwal, vice-president, Automation Industry Association, which represents the likes of Siemens, Larsen & Toubro, Mitsubishi and Rockwell Automation.Infosys expects Covid-19 to lead to higher digitisation in manufacturing.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76128118,imgsize-609857,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/covid-19-disruption-creates-market-boom-for-iot-connected-tech.jpg",cio_etc_iot,"New Delhi: The disruption that Covid-19 has brought about will trigger a boom in the market for Internet of Things , or connected technologies, say industry executives and analysts.

"India is currently in the middle of one of the biggest lockdowns in history. While businesses prepared for remote work facilities in the first half, now the focus should be on post lockdown preparation. As a new normal takes over, India Inc and IT leaders need to implement lessons learnt from Covid-19 ’s impact. And manufacturing CIOs are no different. Maitrey Modha , CTO- AMEA & ANZ, CNH Industrial has this thought out and gives some important advice for vendors and his peers alike. Post lockdown manufacturing will have to ramp up capacity with multiple shifts, probably 24/7, to make up for the loss. And it has to be done over a period of 6-8 months. Modha opines that IT leaders should start evaluation of what all can be done remotely and what all can be automated.“Right from the incoming raw material, sorting and putting it in the respective warehouse, analysis of automatic picking and replenishing to the manufacturing line, pre-dispatch to final inspection of the product needs to be automated. Which would mean that many of the IoT companies would need to come up with customized solutions based on each type of manufacturing process,” Modha said.It isn’t one standard set of tools to be implemented for everyone, but based on the type of manufacturing vendors would have to think of possible solutions for each of the processes and integrate those together to achieve end to end automation , Modha adds.While Modha says automating should be done at large scale, robotics will come into play. “IoT would need to automate to such an extent that the replenishment of material happens through the automated algorithms and the equipment that are used for logistics are enabled with remote working capability and the replenishment of parts happens through the warehouse to line. From the line the robots would automatically continue the assembly,” he said.This has to have an added level of automation and AI. “You are able to do visual inspection over the remote. It would not be completely automated but it would be a mix of remote visualization and remote controlling using these tools and technologies,” Modha added.While Modha narrates lessons for the future he also reveals the BCP at CNH Industrial for seamless operations. Modha and team could provide a work around for product development.To enable remote work, the team first assessed employees using high end desktops and workstations.“We enabled remote desktop access with a secure tool, where through the user's address one can authenticate for the first time, download the signature on a personal PC. One can then log into the workstation from a personal PC and open internet,” Modha said.Modha also claims cloud to be of prime importance at this point. “All the office automation tools are currently utilized from the cloud as on premise infrastructure is not capable of end-to-end work from home solution. So the cloud is of prominence today as internet providers are at their highest capacity now,” he said.Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown to curb the spread has impacted India Inc in an unprecedented way. Primarily the budgets of any organization are being examined. Modha says, “I foresee a lot of budget cuts and a lot of projects getting postponed to the end of the year or next year. Some might even completely get cancelled.” But the silver lining he believes will be more spending on cloud adoption and implementation, on automation, and enabling remote work.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-75340437,imgsize-47289,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/post-lockdown-prep-a-manufacturing-cio-s-message-to-vendors-on-iot-solutions.jpg",cio_etc_iot,"India is currently in the middle of one of the biggest lockdowns in history.

"By Jaganathan Chelliah Video security is not what it used to be. The data-driven tech revolution that has swept across the industrial landscape has also transformed the video security sector, leaving both visible and invisible changes. One of the clearly visible changes has been the rapid evolution of camera devices.The days of fixed type cameras have long given way to a vast range of sophisticated equipment -- pan-tilt-zoom cameras, which can follow a target across the scene, change angles and even zoom in on a face; thermal imaging cameras for 24x7 security, from bright light to dark nights;body-worn cameras used by security personnel, army and police personnel; drone cameras used in a multitude of applications from wedding photography to border security; licence plate recognition cameras that can identify and flag traffic violations; and many more.An even greater impact on the security video industry has been the advent of internet protocol (IP) cameras or connected cameras. These cameras stream data (either continuously or motion triggered) to cloud servers. The opportunities presented by this high level of data generation have led to significant shifts in the video security field.When it comes to security, time itself can be the enemy. Security considerations call for real time analysis of the video data and that is what smart cameras deliver. The camera ‘understands’ the scene and takes action. If it’s an intruder, the camera is able to zoom to capture more detailed footage.If it’s a thermal hotspot in an unoccupied plant, the camera triggers a fire alarm. Smart security cameras do more than stream a static video feed; they are connected to sensors, they have embedded intelligence and storage, and even processing capability within the device itself. In addition, these devices enable a rich stream of video data that can be used in real-time for valuable and actionable insights.This level of real-time computing calls for a blended architecture where the data goes through both cloud-based as well Edge-based analytics. (Edge-based analytics refers to the process of analysing data at the device level or the edge of the network.) Edge-based analytics on the security feed can help counter the issue of latency and enable rapid responses. Deep learning and AI technologies have improved the capabilities of video security systems and allowing them to become exceptionally intelligent.AI-based systems enable cameras to store and process data based on pattern recognition of specific shapes, colours, sounds, vibrations, temperature, chemicals, pressure and so on. Here the role of data becomes critical. Data that is captured at the ‘edge’ is called fast data as it enables faster analytics. Facial recognition in smartphones, pattern recognition in autonomous vehicles, these are some of the contemporary usages of fast data and video data analytics.Smart security video cameras generate a huge amount of fast data and need to be supported with embedded storage and data processing. Such advanced security video solutions require specialised storage that delivers high data access speed with enhanced durability.What you see is what you get. That is why the demand for advanced image analytics has led to an increasing trend towards HD and Ultra High Definition (UHD) video formats. The efficient use of AI-based analytics for pattern recognition demands a higher level of resolution, which is made possible by UHD. This in turn has an impact on the design and architecture of the data storage infrastructure and the network capability to stream such high quantum of data. UHD video requires higher storage capabilities at device, platform and server levels.Although security is still the most common end-use of video security, the technology is being increasingly used to gain competitive advantages in business. Retail enterprises, for instance, can analyse data from video streams for insights on consumer browsing and purchase behaviours. This is a rich and minable stream of data that can be leveraged to help enhance the retail experience. In industries such as manufacturing and healthcare, image recognition cameras can help maintain operational control, for instance, by motion-triggered cameras that identify movement in restricted areas. In urban transportation, smart cameras can help identify incidents and aid in improving the flow of traffic or pedestrians, thus keeping city streets safer.While all of the above trends are spurring the widening rollout of security video systems, the trend of increasingly tighter privacy norms urges a nuanced and thoughtful approach to such rollouts. New regulations and increasing advocacy for data privacy will be a key determinant in how corporations use, store and manage the reams of data that stream from video security systems. The debate around ‘Big Brother’ type scenarios will continue until there is a common rationale and playbook for managing cyber privacy and continued security.IP cameras, AI-based recognition systems, smart security video networks, all of these have led to a paradigm shift in the architecture of security video systems. At the heart of it all is the data capability. Data storage devices form the backbone of such smart security systems, where they are supposed to reliably enable non-stop recording for years. The capability to stream, store and analyse the data, and leverage the data assets for optimal efficiencies is what will deliver actionable insights on video data. With the quantum of data in video feeds increasing exponentially, companies will need to build in big data infrastructure so that the security systems deliver the required impact in a seamless, cost-effective manner.The author is Director, Marketing, Western Digital IndiaDISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

"Co-working space provider Smartworks is using its own operating system for office to stay ahead. In conversation with ETCIO, Harsh Binani , Co-founder of the company talks about their implementation of IoT to cut energy consumption and make it easier for employees to find a meeting room when they need it.Edited excerpts:We have made a lot of investments in building Smart OS (Operating System) to run the office. Smart OS is a combination of a variety of proprietary apps that we have built, combined with a lot of external applications at a higher level. This not only drives our internal program but also a customer-facing interface which touchpoints with our customers.Our entire endeavour is to map and create an ecosystem which drives client engagement at all the touchpoints and unifies all the services. Right from your entrance to the Smartworks office to your exit, we map all the touchpoints digitally.Similarly, we have a visitor management system where rather than entering the details manually, the visitors who come here, can easily walk in seamlessly using a smart pass on his phone and enter an access controlled environment in Smartworks.We have also invested a lot with a third party on making the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Conditioning) systems intelligent. This allows an employee to control the temperature of his surroundings upto 25 m in radius. It not only controls the temperature, but also shows the air quality, humidity and airflow.The exciting developments that have happened in the last 6 months are the meeting room management and booking system.It is something which is fairly unstructured in offices and a lot of meeting rooms end up getting booked without any prior notice. And similarly, who's using the meeting room? What's the purpose, a lot of analytics that needs to be done in a meeting room that is the problem statement that we started with for this entire meeting room solutions.We have developed a proprietary meeting room scheduler application, which works on IoT. We have tablets installed outside each of the meeting rooms which is also integrated with our Smartworks app. Through this app, one can book the meeting room. The distinguishing factor is that it only allows you to use the amenities of the meeting room if you have booked it.Once you have booked the meeting room, you can switch on the light using the electrical connections within the room. Through this we are not only able to plug-in the leakage of energy consumption but also give the power to the user so he can control all the elements of the meeting room.Through the smartworks application, the user can also book beverages or snacks that they want to order during the meeting. So both these features combined to make a very powerful experience within this.The entire HVAC intelligent extract application ends up using less electricity. So, automatically through the tailoring of the entire system, we are able to reduce the electricity consumption at a high level which helps in reducing carbon footprint. Since the last 6 months we've reduced our energy consumption by more than 15 percent.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-74450442,imgsize-50782,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/how-iot-helps-smartworks-increase-employee-productivity.jpg",cio_etc_iot,"Co-working space provider Smartworks is using its own operating system for office to stay ahead.

Dr Rishi Bhatnagar IoT is driving innovation and new opportunities in the digital realm. Traditionally, India has been a consumer of technology and a laggard in adoption, especially when it comes to the network. This time, India too plans to roll out state-of-the-art 5G telecom services with the rest of the world by 2020 driven more by demand than supply. 5G with its high-speed and low latency service will help realise the Government of India’s Digital India, Smart Cities and Digital Villages Missions aiming to improve citizen services, bring transparency and good governance. IoT based solutions and services in healthcare, agriculture and retail when powered by 5G will enable connected and ubiquitous services to the citizens.Enterprises using 5G networks will deploy IoT technology to connect the unconnected products for offering connected services to consumers. Similarly, IoT technology is being applied for predictive maintenance in the automotive sector, smart city projects, smart security and surveillance for safety of citizens from internal and external threats. Other applications of IoT include, smart retail for enhancing customer experience, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, smart agriculture for better food productivity and consumption, smart and connected factories with industries 4.0 and even sustainable development with river rejuvenation, water conservation and water resource monitoring technologies The momentum for IoT-enabled ecosystem is building up in India. Enterprises, SMB’s and government bodies have established working groups dedicated to achieving this goal. Even after having several models of standards development, such as the proprietary- and government-led models, collaborative standards development has apprehended a superior position. Creating an application ecosystem, preparing the network infrastructure and establishing strategic partnerships are essential to help develop sustainable business models for IoT ecosystem.Steps to be taken:IoT is a growing paradigm with technical, social, and economic significance. Recently a joint report published by ASSOCHAM and EY claimed that in a hyper-connected India, IoT has the potential to reach an estimated 2 billion connections, unlocking revenues of USD 11.1 billion by 2022. However, this technology poses very critical security challenges which needs to be addressed for IoT to reach its full potential. Though many IoT security considerations are not necessarily new being inherited from the use of networking technologies. However, IoT is getting featured in almost all the security prediction lists for 2019 – Beyond all-too-common corporate attacks, 2018 witnessed increased threats across a diverse range of targets and victims.The safeguard of IoT deployments depends on the protection of all systems involved (the devices and sensors that collect data, network, cloud backend and services, applications, maintenance and diagnostic tools, etc.). Addressing these challenges and ensuring security in IoT products and services is critical and has to be taken up on priority as attacks on IoT deployments could dramatically jeopardise people’s security, privacy and safety, while additionally IoT in itself can be used as an attack vector against other critical infrastructures. Also, since IoT can drastically change the ways personal data is collected, analysed, used, and protected, privacy concerns have been raised. These need to be addressed to ensure user trust and confidence in the Internet, connected devices, and related services.As hackers become more sophisticated, so should response and risk mitigation strategies. The first step towards protection is awareness followed by vigilance with diligence. A multi-layered security policy that helps detect and isolate risks across the threat lifecycle will also help. But strategy must address all the complex layers and integrations IoT is built with. I believe that it is crucial for securing IoT offerings at the design stage rather than attempting to hold back the tide of attacks and adding security to systems once they have been deployed. Given the way the world is getting more and more connected, security can no longer be an afterthought for IoT players. Security measures must be designed in from the start and treated as an ongoing process.Industry 4.0 has made inroads in Indian manufacturing to support the digitization efforts in both the public and private sector. The Government of India in their recent announcement has reduced corporate tax rate for domestic companies to 22 per cent, provided no exemptions or incentives are availed, bringing the effective tax rate to 25.17 per cent including all surcharges and cesses. This will be a boost for India’s ‘Make in India’ programme making India’s IoT Industry grow stronger every day.These are very encouraging initiatives taken both by the government however a lot more required to realize the full potential of IoT. A strong need for a shift in mindset is required before there is a shift in capacity. Instead of just undertaking more capital expenditure, the focus should be on enhancing existing asset base. Adopting IoT will give a new lease of life to industrialization in India.The author is President at Aeris Communications and Chairman IET IoT PanelDISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

"Smart devices fueled by the hyper connected Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming ever more prevalent and pervasive in our personal lives. Sensors are everywhere, and the trend will only continue. Today, sensor-equipped industrial equipment are powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Medical devices can self-diagnose and send alerts to patients and doctors to remotely manage healthcare. Automobiles with in-car connectivity can download new features on the fly.Every industry is seeking ways to use sensors or device-enabled insights to improve our lives and health of machines. With the number of connected devices expected to swell well beyond 30 billion by 2020, the opportunities to use IoT to reshape industries and societies will also multiply. Enterprises that adopt IoT have decreased supply chain costs by more than 20%, increased productivity by 10% to 20%, and reduced design-to-market time by 20% to 50%.Yet, 60% of top IT executives polled by Cognizant ’s Centre for the Future of Work say that IoT will add tremendous complexity to their IT infrastructure in areas such as networking, integration and data analysis. This analysis has also brought to the fore the following challenges that companies face during IoT implementations:-IoT security (32%)-Facilitating cross-department implementation (31%)-Integrating disparate data (30%)-Dearth of skilled talent equipped with IoT knowledge (29%)As navigating these challenges requires careful planning, domain knowledge and rigorous implementation, there are a few things businesses can do to maximise the benefits of their IoT implementations.Edge computing and analytics can collect, pre-process and filter data to deliver compact, clear and precise data. This, in turn, will help reduce transmission, processing and storage costs.An edge-processing system can also send commands to IoT devices and perform software upgrades in a few milliseconds, compared to a cloud system, which could take more than 100 milliseconds. Additionally, edge gateways can transform proprietary or legacy protocols into IoT protocols for transmission to existing corporate networks or the cloud.Data ingestion and stream processing help by restructuring the process of collecting, storing, integrating and analysing data, which are critical to the successful implementation of IoT. The process helps in effective IoT implementation by importing and converting telemetry data into a format that can be used by cloud-based IoT services. Streamlining also helps assess the expected data message size, criticality and required response time to ensure the cloud components can process the data required to meet business KPIs and IoT goals.The rapid proliferation of IoT sensors, and the growing complexity and volume of data exchanges have made it imperative for organisations to adopt and enforce the best of security practices and procedures. Organisations must look at increasing the scale of investments, talent as well as thought leadership around security as IoT implementations grow in scale and start becoming the backbone of day-to-day operations in organisations.Device management enables devices to communicate seamlessly with other devices and cloud platforms while helping the enterprise scale to billions of connected devices and trillions of messages. Six out of 10 IT executives feel that collecting, storing, analysing and integrating data from end point devices is a key barrier for IoT devices. Efficient device management will not only facilitate this, but will also immediately escalate to the staff and systems in case of failure or misuse of device. This will, in turn, reduce management costs.With cold path processing, large amounts of data are analysed by advanced algorithms after the data is stored on the cloud platform. More sophisticated big data analytics, machine learning and AI are applied to provide more comprehensive insights. This can help uncover trends and corrective actions that are needed to improve the business (on how to implement IoT better) and customer experience.IoT insights need to be delivered to enterprise systems and reference metadata must be received in order to effectively interpret device data. With deep enterprise integration, the IoT architecture can deliver benefits such as improved efficiencies, reduced costs, increased sales, heightened customer satisfaction and the ability to create and lead new markets. This can also help address many of the aforementioned challenges for enterprises and set a roadmap for successful IoT implementation.Enterprises need to keep in mind that every IoT implementation will be distinct in its own way, depending on business requirements, expected outcomes, levels of IoT and data skills, and technology infrastructure maturity. The above five actions are essential in ensuring successful IoT deployment, with minimal cost and delay.Organisations must conduct a rigorous ‘needs’ assessment and carefully plan their roadmap to deliver a flexible, secure and scalable IoT solution. They must also consider using pre-built solutions, reference architectures and blueprints from experienced technology service providers to make the most of their IoT initiatives.The author is Global Delivery Head, Digital Business, Cognizant.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

NEW DELHI: Internet of Things IoT ) is a departure for telecom operators from their traditional business which can prove to be highly lucrative amidst economic slowdown, however, telcos need to act timely and find the fastest route to creating business value in this segment, industry stakeholders believe.As revenues dry up from traditional streams of mobility services amidst slowdown, intense competition and price wars, telcos are now focusing on emerging technologies and core emerging services, especially in the areas of IoT.“IoT is expected to provide ample new revenue streams for telcos, who have made significant investments to capture and monetize the potential. While telcos have developed the necessary infrastructure to provide IoT services, they would need new business models, cross-sector partnerships,” Sathish Gopalaiah, partner and telecom sector leader, Deloitte India told ET.All three Indian telecom operators Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, and Bharti Airtel are preparing to launch narrow-band IoT (NB-IoT) commercially in the next few months after having run pilots in different circles both in consumer space and commercial space. NB-IoT is a new standard connecting internet of things projects.However, telcos could be running behind in the Internet of Things (IoT) race due to the late deployment resulting in missed opportunities, told Ali Hosseini, founder & CEO of SenRa – a long range wide area network (LoRaWAN) operator.Therefore, it is imperative that with the hype and urgency around IoT adoption, finding the fastest path to business value is going to be the key for telcos to succeed in this wave of digital revolution, suggested Gopalaiah.Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea did not respond to ET's queries till publishing time of the story.According to SenRa’s Hosseini, telcos need to catch the IoT market now as once the smart city tenders close on what IoT technology to use (LoRaWAN, NB-IoT or SigFox), the technology will be locked in for as many as 10 to 20 years. If telcos don't catch the market now, they'll probably have to wait another 20 years in some cases.Beyond traditional mobility services, telcos have the opportunity to extend to newer verticals such as smart homes, consumer electronics, smart vehicles, wearables, smart buildings, smart utilities, manufacturing, smart cities, retail, healthcare and enterprise among others.Apart from use cases for revenue streams, IoT as a platform also provides opportunity for telcos to transform their own operations. “Telcos can be the orchestrators to deliver the IoT symphony with adequate technology platforms, scalable business models and a right strategy in place,” said Deloitte’s Gopalaiah.He added that telecom service providers need to assume a broader role to become platform and application providers than just being a connectivity provider to create new revenue streams in the IoT market.As per a GSMA report, consumer IoT connections in itself has potential 11 billion connections and industrial IoT would have potential of additional 14 billion connections by 2025 which would surpass the existing count of traditional mobile connections.IoT opportunity could represent $9 billion by 2020 from $1.3 billion in 2016 in terms of revenue — a growth of 700%. Government of India though is aiming to create a $15 billion IoT industry in India by 2020, as per Deloitte.According to Cisco’s Sanjay Kaul, head of Asia Pacific & Japan, service provider business, telcos have a huge revenue growth opportunity in the enterprise segment, especially in the IoT domain. “When 5G comes, things will be very different. Our research tells us that in APJC, around 70% of the SP revenue will come from enterprises. Currently, it is about 30%,” he said.However, in India, challenges of IoT adoption are many unlike the developed countries. “India is faced with multiple challenges related to cost of the solution, security and network. Our networks are still expanding; some cities in India don't even have backhaul connectivity,” pointed Praveen Arora, VP-operation and technology, Internet of Things, Tata Communications.Deloitte believes that the Indian manufacturing sector has underperformed compared to other sectors and its contribution to GDP has stagnated and IoT could be the answer to create the impact and come out of the slump.“5G use cases around smart manufacturing will help the sector to achieve efficiencies bringing in cost reductions and as well as leverage it to achieve productivity and profitability. This provides valuable propositions for the telcos which would also bring great value and contribution towards their revenues,” said Deloitte’s Gopalaiah.Besides smart manufacturing or connected industry, smart city and healthcare use cases are the most widely adopted across the globe.Together connected industry (17%) and smart city (27%) account for 44% of the use cases across the globe which provides IoT services an opportunity to catapult and has the maximum space to ring in the volume game in terms of revenue making , according to Deloitte India TMT India predictions - 2019.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-72003504,imgsize-751305,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/iot-can-be-a-cash-cow-amidst-economic-slump-provided-telcos-step-up-their-game.jpg",cio_etc_iot,"71967745

"By Amit Aggarwal IoT products are a major component of Industry 4.0 which brings together advances in computational power, wireless communication, AI, and data to build a vast technology infrastructure that works nearly autonomously.The size of the IoT market is expected to grow spectacularly over the next decade. Globally, by 2020, it is expected to reach $7 trillion, and in India $9.2 billion.Huge advances in manufacturing have allowed even small manufacturers to produce relatively sophisticated IoT products. This brings to the surface issues of patents governing IoT products and communication standards governing devices.Until now most manufacturers of IoT products sought patents on physical products, the configuration of devices and their structures, output, and operation. Most IoT devices work within electronic products, healthcare products, and household products. Patenting products in which IoT devices can be used could potentially stymie the growth of the IoT industry. Thankfully examples set by some of the largest technology companies in the world including Apple, IBM, Samsung, and Qualcomm reveal there is a wide range of products that can be embedded with IoT devices.New IoT products are regularly conceived and their function cannot be patented. Hence a tiny IoT capsule that upon being swallowed, captures and relays images from inside the human body cannot be patented. This allows companies that didn’t conceive of an IoT product to also manufacture a somewhat identical device. Functions for which IoT products can be created are numerous as well.The manufacture of IoT products remains a frontier. Already such products are commonplace and growing in sophistication. Startups are designing novel IoT products that can be embedded with IoT devices. As there is no patent infrastructure governing what kind of product can become an IoT, there is tremendous scope for companies to design IoT products. The technologies and standards that allow IoT devices to communicate are difficult to patent as well.Several Indian manufacturers of IoT products are growing larger supported by a patent infrastructure that is loosely defined enough to allow different technologies and standards to work side-by-side.Such technologies and standards work side-by-side in the following way. A smart home has IoT enabled products that manage lighting, entertainment, security, climate, appliances, power consumption, pool temperature, and much more. Each IoT product may be manufactured by different manufacturers that hold patents on components they have created. Patents govern how the IoT products used in smart homes, work and communicate with IoT products designed by different manufacturers. However, because the IoT patent ecosystem isn’t defined, new companies can take advantage of communication standards they haven’t created. Hence a startup may create an IoT product for home automation that works hand-in-hand with other patented products.While the potential of IoT is vast, a clearer picture of how IoT products will be used in the future needs to emerge. It is unclear today how to draft a patent framework that allows seamless communication between IoT devices manufactured by different companies adhering to different standards.The lack of a patent infrastructure and vast scope of IoT mean companies in this space can continue to create new kinds of IoT products and take advantage of standards they haven’t created. For now, the patent infrastructure in the IoT space remains open enough to not hamper the growth of the industry so players can grow larger and more numerous.The author is Co- Founder and Director of Effectual ServicesDISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

"Sangarmesh Talikotti has been a farmer for 20 years and is well aware of the unpredictable factors that can affect his livelihood each season.The 40-year-old also knows that he has to use a mix of the traditional knowledge acquired over the years and modern methods to minimise the risks he faces every season. So when he heard about deploying internet of things ( IoT technology in farming, Talikotti did not hesitate. In March, he spentRs 38,000 to plant three sensors on his 2.5-acre tomato farm.The artificial intelligence-driven platform from Benguluru-based agri-tech startup Fasal regularly relays information to Talikotti’s smartphone. He gets updates on when to irrigate the field, when to reap the crops, what is the risk of pest attack and where to use pesticides.Talikotti is so impressed with the system that he now intends to install sensors across his 60-acre farm where he grows papayas, brinjals and drumsticks. He is especially happy that his fate is not entirely based on the variables anymore, all thanks to Fasal.The startup, which has 30 employees, “tries to take the guesswork out of farming,” says Ananda Verma, founder & CEO. “We are a precision agriculture company with a focus on horticulture.” Using software engineers, pathologists, horticulture experts and AI experts, startups like Fasal, AgSmartic, CropIn and others collect farm data, analyse these and present helpful and remedial information to farmers.Hemant Wavhal, 35, is happy that he gave Fasal Rs 47,000 in February to deploy sensors on his two-acre pomegranate farm at Alephata village in Pune district. He claims to have already saved around Rs 30,000 on plant protection chemicals as the sensors pinpoint where to spray the chemical.Technology is beneficial for farmers looking to minimise risks and increase output. Talikotti and Wavhal will vouch for that. They are among a small but increasing number of agrarians employing technology to take the guesswork out of their profession. This has, in turn, birthed an ecosystem of small and big companies trying to bring about smart transformations in farming.Basically, sensors collect temperature, light, Ph values, moisture content and other such readings. Some sensors are deployed about 18 inches below the soil to collect microclimatic readings and soil data. IoT converts these data into precise actionable intelligence for farmers. And these companies are collecting and analysing that data to help farmers.The ecosystem can help the government achieve its goal of doubling farm income by 2022. It can also power the rural economy, seen as an important engine that will propel India towards its goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025, from $2.7 trillion now.These goals can be easily achieved if farming gets a tech upgrade. Harsha Razdan, partner & head of consumer markets & retail, KPMG India, says, “Low spending on R&D, low productivity and small farm holdings are the problems. These conditions are fertile for technology providers to disrupt the sector and improve yields.”R&D spend on agriculture as a percentage of GDP is only 0.7% in India, according to the Economic Survey 2020. It is 2.8% in the US, 2.1% in China and 4.2% in Israel. Even farm mechanisation is low in India, at 40%, when compared with 60% in China and 75% in Brazil.Not surprisingly, tech companies and startups see an opportunity to upgrade the around $400 billion Indian agriculture sector. There are 896 agri-tech startups providing tech tools for pre-harvest, post-harvest and during plant-growing periods, according to Tracxn data as on July 1. They have attracted $560 million of venture funding, most of it in the last three years. In two years, according to Maple Capital Advisors, agri-tech ventures will attract another $500 million.With that kind of potential, former investment banker Taranjeet Singh Bhamra had no trouble in deciding to start AgNext in 2016. The Chandigarh-based startup uses computer vision and spectroscopy for post-harvest inspection of tea leaves.“About $3 billion worth of tea trade happens annually via visual inspection -- by keeping a few leaves on the ground and deciding on the quality of tea. We built a technology that analyses the leaves by checking the fibre content,” says Singh. It took AgNext 18 months and half a billion leaves to develop an algorithm to detect the quality of tea leaves more quickly and effectively.Technology is also being used to scale up vegetables cultivation. Take, for instance, potatoes, which get destroyed by early-morning frost. Farmers generally leave water pumps on through the night as wet soil offers better protection from frost. But too much water can also be harmful. There is help at hand now as sensors can predict when there is a chance of frost and decide if the irrigation system should be switched on.CropIn, which gives agri-tech solutions to brinjal, tomato and onion farmers in Jharkhand and Orissa, claims to have helped its partners increase productivity by around 30% over the last three years by providing such information.“IoT and agriculture are tied to each other,” says Alok Bardiya, head of IoT, Tata Communications, which had rolled out a low-power wide-area network protocol in India in 2017. This basically allows long-range transmission of data using less power, making it suitable to connect sensors deployed over a vast area. This data from the ground makes sense for farming only when juxtaposed with satellite data, which is collected by companies such as SatSure.“We look for proxy indicators,” says Prateep Basu, a former ISRO scientist who started SatSure in 2016. “For example, water in soil has a different signal than just soil. We can predict droughts using such technology.”The most challenging aspect of agri-tech ventures will be understanding the vagaries of monsoon. Skymet Weather Services, India’s first private weather forecaster, understands how testing that can be. It has 7,500 sensors and 100 crop cameras across the country collecting data, which is used to create actionable information.“Technology can help agriculture by minimising weather risks, pest risks and input risks,” says Jatin Singh, CEO of Skymet. Sensors and cameras can keep tabs on pheromone traps and relay relevant information to farmers. Noida-based AgSmartic Technologies uses autonomous systems to provide early pest detection warning. Abhishek Sinha, CEO & cofounder, says the company has deployed sensors on 570 acres of farms at three locations in Punjab.Apart from acting as a pest monitoring system, these also collect soil temperature and moisture levels. This information can show stress in water demand, which can trigger autonomous irrigation. Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy officer of Tech Mahindra, says, “Cre-ation of an agri stack which will connect all stakeholders across the ecosystem is the next logical step.” As companies harness technology to do more with less, some startups are offering a way to grow vegetables without soil.Chennai-based Aqua Farms, for one, hydroponic home kits that are plug-and-play solutions to grow leafy greens. The kit comprises a nutrient filling technology and costs Rs 6,000-45,000 for output of 2-20 per month. Since starting the sales in January 2019, the company has sold 1,000 kits across India. This trend could pick up as cities are built and people opt for home-vegetables. The technique could find more land-scarce urban hubs.\Hyderabad-based UrbanKisaan uses hydroponics to grow vegetables at a commercial scale. Started in 2017, UrbanKisaan grows 70 varieties of crops, including tomatoes, potatoes and onions, in indoor farms that are no more than 2,500 sq feet. “We grow 30x more vegetables than what can be done in soil farming, using 95% less water. 2,000 sq feet equals 2 acres of farm output,” says Vihari Kanukollu, CEO & cofounder, UrbanKisaan, which sells its produce online. As indoor farming tries to mimic the outdoor environment, the reliance on tech gets higher. Sensors continuously monitor temperature, moisture and humidity, among others.Tech is especially useful in these closed and confined settings. Another system being deployed is aquaponics, which uses nutrientrich water from fish tanks to feed vegetables before circulating the water back into the fish tanks. Here, again, technology has made the technique sustainable. If the Ph levels in water is high, plants will die. If it falls, fish will perish. So there is heavy dependence on sensors and IoT to maintain the right balance in the ecosystem.Anubhav Das, 46, became so fascinated by this system that he decided to plunge into it, despite having worked as a photographer and brand strategist for almost two decades.After learning aquaponics system design at the Aquaponics Institute of Australia in Melbourne, he set up Red Otter Farms on an acre close to Nanital in Uttarakhand. “There is consistency in quality of the output, soil contaminants are removed and there are no impurities.” He grows lettuce, kale, rocket leaves, swiss chard, arugula and other leafy greens and sells them directly to at least 100 subscribers in the Delhi-NCR region. Despite agri-tech having many benefits, issues like erratic network and high costs could slow the rate of adoption.Besides farmers have to see savings and growth in their incomes before they decide to go all in -- which would be easier said than done in a country where they still face economic hardship regularly.But if a concerted push from the government and the companies succeeds in ensuring a wider adoption of agri-tech, farms in India can become more profitable in three to five years. Even if monsoon threatens to hurt farmers, data from clouds could save them.There are 146 million farms. How many have adopted technology? These are interesting showpieces. Unless there is money for farmers, these technologies will not scale up. These are experiments. Out of 100 startups, not even 10 scale up. Technologies bring revolution only when there is profit for farmers.Who will bear the cost of digital technologies, including AI, IoT and ML, is the issue. The government can’t give subsidy for everything.The question is, is the customer ready to pay for it? The whole process has to start at the farmers’ level. Aggregation has to be done: let 50 farmers come together, let them wash, dry, put barcodes on produce to identify which place it has come from for traceability. Then it should be graded in terms of quality — A, B, C. Are we getting that type of thing?These have not scaled in India. Will customers be ready to pay, say, Rs 200 for a kilo of cherry tomatoes from hydroponics, when regular farm tomatoes are available for Rs 40 a kg? In the last three months, tomato prices have fluctuated — from Rs 12 per kg to Rs 80 per kg (at Azadpur market in Delhi). How will farmers recover costs in technology when there are such wild price fluctuations? The question is, when tech comes from lab to land, what is the cost involved and what is the price farmers will get for the output? Farmers says, ‘the more I produce, the less I get’ — they are unable to recover their costs.There is no dearth of technology to increase production. We have to look at where it will be absorbed and at what price. Recently, in Rajasthan, farmers blocked a road in Jaipur because mustard price was 25% below MSP. Unless you can ensure profitable cultivation, technologies can never take off. And you can’t run it on a subsidy model.Digitisation tools are cutting down costs. But give farmers a costbenefit analysis. Just showing that a tool can increase productivity by 20-30% is not enough. Show when cost will go down and profits will go up 10%, or 20%, or 30%.If you plan to double the output in the next 5-10 years, you can do it. If the market collapses (due to oversupply) and farmers can’t recover the cost, then forget it. Focus on developing the market. Create demand. Otherwise, these are white elephants. I am not totally against tech — but 90% of tech focusses on production and that is where the problem starts. If you look at the history of revolutions — green, white or poultry — there were markets for them.There are broadly three kinds of technologies: for seeds and nutrients; machine technology like tractors, irrigation pumps and sprinklers; and information technology. There is a fair amount of interplay of all three. Interestingly, Covid-19 has led to increased automation. There has been a more aggressive adoption of machines and technology after labour moved back home because of Covid-19 and lockdown. The last few quarters have seen the use of sensor technology and data analytics in farms. There are around 500 startups offering agritech — all of them have good tech ideas.Technologies have to translate into specific action and more income for farmers. If you say, I can bring micro local weather forecast, that by itself does not mean anything. It has to be combined with soil data, farm data, what was planted last season and combined with the data of the farmer, like investment capacity, labour availability, credit availability and so on, before being used to make a crop recommendation. Aggregators who are stitching all of this together will be essential in the ecosystem. E-Choupal 4.0, our current version, is one such aggregator. The second challenge is in developing a profitable business model. You make water-saving devices and precision farming tech, but water and power are free. You will be competing in a distorted market.Look at demand signals. What to grow? What varieties within crops? Then use technologies that help save money. Like those that check for pests and give weather forecast and soil reports. Third is marketplace of inputs — seeds, nutrients, crop protection, equipment for hire, etc. Last is access to markets with links to warehouses, derivative markets, F&O. Aggregators integrate all of these and offer a complete solution.Putting sensors and doing IoT are expensive for small farmers. It will work better in a hub-and-spoke model. Put sensors in one farm (the hub) and share (the data) with other farms so you have 150-200 farms around this hub. This can be provided to farmers as a service. We are only in the second season of these experiments. We can’t just say it worked in one season, so let us now expand it to a million acres. Because some mistake here could mean a huge impact on farmers. The experiments need to be properly validated.The government has data of soil, weather, etc. this can be put as a foundational digital stack. the government can build appropriate apis and offer this data to tech companies. once the government’s digital agri stack is built, it will help scale much better.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-77052818,imgsize-267120,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/can-high-tech-firms-with-actionable-inputs-eliminate-uncertainties-in-agriculture.jpg",ettechtech,"Sangarmesh Talikotti has been a farmer for 20 years and is well aware of the unpredictable factors that can affect his livelihood each season.The 40-year-old also knows that he has to use a mix of the traditional knowledge acquired over the years and modern methods to minimise the risks he faces every season.

With the $28 billion he’s raised working from home, India’s richest man wants to step into the breach created by the technology cold war between America and China. The two Silicon Valley tech giants that gave him a third of the money will help put him there.It’s an audacious plan. Politicians in many nations, including the U.S., the U.K. and India, are reluctant to let Huawei , which they accuse of being an instrument of the Chinese state, become embedded in the fast-speed internet networks that will run everything from power stations to autonomous cars.Ambani’s four-year-old Jio Platforms has indigenously built its own 5G technology, the tycoon announced at Wednesday’s annual general meeting of his flagship Reliance Industries Ltd. After testing it on the 400 million 4G customers he has in India, he’ll offer it to other markets. The news18.com website, also controlled by Ambani, called the technology a “Huawei-killer,” and noted that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had praised Jio as a clean network for not using the Chinese firm’s gear.While details of Ambani’s 5G prowess and the markets he hopes to target are still fuzzy, the planned assault against handset makers is clearer. Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai made a virtual appearance at the Reliance AGM and pledged $4.5 billion for a 7.7% stake in Jio and a chance to build an Android operating system.The cheap smartphones running it will migrate 350 million Indians who still use feature phones to mobile internet. But how much customization will Google be comfortable with? If it’s a lot, the phone may be affordable but tied to Jio’s apps. Too little, and the pricing may be unattractive. Somewhere in between those extremes, it’s a threat to Xiaomi . As Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai notes, India accounted for 35% of the Chinese vendor’s smartphone shipments last year.One more thing is now evident: WhatsApp, the messaging system of Facebook , which has given Jio $5.7 billion for a near-10% stake, will drive commerce. The blueprint is again Chinese. WhatsApp’s popularity, and its ability to handle payments in real time, make it a perfect platform for Ambani to build a super-app like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat, connecting brands with customers.The 300,000 Reliance investors who watched the AGM on JioMeet, Ambani’s cloud-conferencing clone of Zoom, probably found the sharp pivot away from hydrocarbons a bit too much to take. Ambani dropped enough hints that last year’s plan to sell 20% of his mainstay oils-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco was now unlikely.Given the coronavirus situation, writing a $15 billion check would be a further strain on Aramco’s $75 billion-a-year dividend payout, as my colleague David Fickling has noted. Still, Reliance shares fell 3.8% after Ambani said the unit will be spun off and seek new investors.Reliance may get saddled with a permanent discount as a holding company of digital, retail and hydrocarbon assets, but the empire could as easily command a premium as India’s undeclared national champion.Just as Ambani wants to emulate several successful Chinese firms at once, the country’s policy makers want the same thing for the broader economy: make India the world’s factory, by lodging it into the growing chasm between the West and China. But neither the physical infrastructure, nor most of India Inc.’s balance sheet, is ready. After the pandemic, everything from a broken financial sector to grossly inadequate worker housing, healthcare and social security will compete for fiscal sops from a government trying to retain its tenuous investment-grade rating.Reliance’s capital-raising spree has made it free of net debt. It’s willing to run with Prime Minister Modi’s buy-Indian agenda. Its grocery business would lift farmer incomes by direct purchasing. Jio’s cheap cloud services for small businesses would help them digitize. By connecting to JioMart, a virtual store, neighborhood shops could outgrow their limited shelf space, Ambani said. JioMeet could become as a virtual classroom to the country. Reliance also wants to supply cleaner auto fuels to end Indian cities’ crippling pollution problem.As India has learned from China, economic policy that aligns itself with the expansion of a few large capitalists is more manageable — and produces faster results — than one that has to play referee to free and open competition. By the time that throws up a winner, Vietnam and Bangladesh might corner the export opportunity that India wants to claim.India’s competitive landscape would have been broadened had Google’s Pichai bought a stake in Jio’s telecom competitor Vodafone Idea, a plan it was considering, according to a Financial Times report in May. Although that deal is probably now dead, Pichai might still pitch his own tent separately from Ambani’s. So far, he’s only decided on the handset partnership with Jio. There’s still plenty left in the $10 billion kitty he set aside for India this week.There’s also Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos. It will be surprising if, after committing $5.5 billion to the country, he bows out. As for Ambani, he still has to demonstrate that one company can be India’s answer to everything, from Zoom and Tencent to Huawei and Xiaomi, while also being a large telco like Verizon Communications",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76998769,imgsize-749704,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/view-can-ambani-take-on-chinese-giants-like-tencent-huawei-and-xiaomi.jpg",ettechtech,"By Andy Mukherjee

"Reliance said Jio had developed its own 5G technology and plans to offer it to other telecom companies, a move that will pit it against the likes of Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Samsung, in what analysts said was the first such initiative by a mobile phone operator. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said Wednesday that its telecom unit had created a complete 5G solution, using 100% homegrown technologies that will allow it to launch next-generation, high-speed services in India.With India looking to keep Huawei and ZTE out following hostilities on the border with China, dependence on the other overseas suppliers would have increased costs, analysts said.""This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available and can be ready for field deployment next year,"" RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a speech at the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. ""Because of Jio's converged, all-IP network architecture, we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G. Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio Platforms would be well positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally, as a complete managed service.""India's 5G trials and spectrum auctions have been delayed, pending clarity on Huawei's participation.Ambani said Jio Platforms had been conceived with the vision of developing an original, captive intellectual property using which ""we can demonstrate the transformative power of technology across multiple Industry ecosystems... First in India... and then confidently offering these Made-in-India solutions to the rest of the world.""ET was the first to report on Jio's 5G technology plans on March 10.The development comes as Huawei and ZTE may get frozen out of other countries owing to heightened suspicions over the links between the Chinese vendors and their government. The US has long been campaigning to exclude Huawei while the UK recently banned the purchase of Huawei 5G equipment and said any such gear that's installed needs to be removed by 2027.Analysts said that Jio's move to develop its own 5G technology is aimed at reducing dependence on foreign vendors and cost-related advantages. This also comes at a time when India is seen to be lagging behind China and others in terms of technology such as 5G. Jio is currently working with South Korea's Samsung for its pan-India 4G LTE and IoT (internet of things) networks. It also works with players like Nokia for its wireline network in the country.""Technologies like OpenRAN and Cloud are threatening the monopoly of traditional players like Nokia, Ericsson, and Huawei. Jio is leveraging these technologies to develop its own 5G solutions and is well set to take advantage of its acquisitions of Rancore Technologies and Radisys. These companies are playing a crucial role here in Jio's 5G journey,"" said Rohan Dhamija, partner, South Asia, Analysys Mason.Jio has the financial resources to make such a dramatic move, said Mahesh Uppal, director at telecom consultancy firm Com First. However, it is a new player in the competitive space. ""It is ambitious of Jio to focus on 5G technology, where we can expect a lot of action in the coming years. If successful, Jio would be a major achievement for India's telecom sector. Only time will tell if it can succeed,"" he said.""It is not very clear if it is an infrastructure play or just the integration play. If it is infrastructure play, then you will be competing with traditional vendors. That's a very different play because no telco has done that so far,"" said Sanjay Kapoor, former Airtel CEO. ""OpenRAN and Cloud haven't gained acceptance in the global market and are still at the development stage.""The acquisitions of Rancore and Radisys accelerated Jio's in-house development capabilities around open-source technologies and network function virtualisation (NFV) adoption, paving way for the development for IoT platforms and applications, analysts said.Having developed end-to-end 5G technology, Jio said it now wants to bring a wide array of use cases such as security and surveillance using drones, industrial IoT and digitisation in the agriculture sector.The US, the UK, China, Australia, South Korea, Japan and a number of European countries have already launched 5G services. India, on the other hand, has delayed a planned 5G spectrum auction until 2021 due to the unavailability of use cases and lack of interest from private telecom operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea that have also said that the base price - Rs 492 crore a unit - was too high and wouldn't attract bids.Jio had previously informed the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and sought its approval to conduct 5G trials based on its own technology. It had earlier given a separate presentation to the DoT to explain its technology and possible use cases. But these trials are also yet to be held, pending clarity on Huawei.Jio had also submitted separate applications for 5G field trials, with all other telecom gear vendors, including Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and ZTE. Vodafone Idea and Airtel too had submitted their proposals jointly with Ericsson, Nokia, and Chinese giant Huawei.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76978211,imgsize-490502,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/reliance-announces-homegrown-5g-solution.jpg",ettechtech,"Reliance said Jio had developed its own 5G technology and plans to offer it to other telecom companies, a move that will pit it against the likes of Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Samsung, in what analysts said was the first such initiative by a mobile phone operator.

"The Covid-19 pandemic’s fallout is likely to hit electric vehicle (EV) startups the hardest, according to a new report, as they had invested heavily on growth but have hardly been generating any cash. EV sales , like sales of traditional petrol and diesel-powered automobiles, are expected to remain subdued in the current fiscal year, and startups and small and medium enterprises that make up most of the sector “will struggle for survival”, according to the report on the state of the EV sector by Avendus Capital “A significant portion of the EV industry in India is represented by SMEs and start-ups. The Covid-19 lockdown is expected to affect this part of the industry the most,” it said.Traditional manufacturers that have entered EV sector are also expected to turn away from the segment -- which makes up just 0.01% of India’s auto market -- and focus on reviving sales of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the short term.This would mean fewer new launches in the EV segment as manufacturers work to restore sales of their “bread-and-butter” ICE products.Sales of three-wheeler and four-wheeler EVs will remain low, as consumer preference will shift towards personal mobility in the short term, hurting the market for cabs and auto rickshaws, which was expected to adopt EVs faster than retail consumers.However, the two-wheeler EV segment could benefit from the pandemic, the report added.“EV purchase decisions are influenced more by the value proposition rather than only on comfort or leisure. To that extent, the impact of reduction in discretionary consumer expenditure is less likely to affect EVs than ICE vehicles,” the report said, adding that the share of EVs in India’s two-wheeler market could increase in the current fiscal year.Moreover, it said that while the pandemic might have pushed back EV sales targets by a year, the proposition for shifting to such vehicles could get stronger once the outbreak blows over.E-commerce, which is expected to grow due to the pandemic, is being seen as a big adopter of the technology , as is the commercial vehicle segment, which could make the jump to EVs quickly once the market for mobility starts to grow.“FY22 was expected to be the inflection year for the Indian EV industry. In the context of Covid-19, the inflection point is likely to get delayed by a year. But the EV transition post the inflection point will be faster and the industry is expected to stay on track to achieve the FY25 penetration levels,” the report said.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76867282,imgsize-93086,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/electric-vehicle-startups-hit-hardest-by-virus-outbreak.jpg",ettechtech,"The Covid-19 pandemic’s fallout is likely to hit electric vehicle (EV) startups the hardest, according to a new report, as they had invested heavily on growth but have hardly been generating any cash.

"A consortium of India’s Bharti Enterprises and the UK government has won a bid to take over OneWeb , offering to invest $1 billion (Rs 7,465 crore) in the British firm that went bankrupt while trying to build a constellation of satellites to deliver wireless broadband globally.The two partners will invest $500 million each in OneWeb, which aims to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband services, especially in rural areas, and take on the likes of Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink and Jeff Bezos’s Amazon-linked Project Kuiper.The British government will take a significant equity share in OneWeb, UK business secretary Alok Sharma said in a statement. Bharti, he said, would provide commercial and operational leadership, and bring OneWeb a revenue base to contribute towards its future success.The UK and Bharti, which is making the investment through overseas arm Bharti Global, didn’t announce how much stake they would own until press time Friday. People in the know said each would get a 45% stake, with existing investors retaining the remaining 10%.“Bharti will be leading the effort to deliver the promise of universal broadband connectivity through OneWeb, with active support and participation of the British government,” Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal said in a separate statement.Sunil Mittal’s son Shravin, as a director of Bharti Global, led the bid for the Bharti Enterprises arm which has numerous investments across telecoms, technology , hospitality, transportation and energy segments.Bharti Enterprises, the holding company of Bharti Airtel , India’s second largest telco, was one of the founding members of OneWeb and had a strategic stake in the company prior to the latest developments.OneWeb was founded in 2014 by entrepreneur Greg Wyler. It had raised about $3.3 billion in debt and equity from a clutch of investors such as SoftBank, Airbus, Qualcomm, Coca Cola, Intelsat and Grupo Salinas. It collapsed into bankruptcy in March after its biggest investor, SoftBank, pulled back its funding. An auction was held on Thursday.The new proposed investment, which is expected to help the company complete construction of the constellation, is subject to a clearance from a US court and other regulatory approvals, and is expected to close before the end of the year, the UK government said in its statement.Mittal said this business had “substantial commercial use cases” across the telecoms, enterprise, aviation and maritime sectors, and with strong operational execution, Bharti would be able to generate an attractive return for investors, while also ensuring Britain plays a leading role in space and next-generation communications.“Further, India’s leading-edge capabilities in the space programme through the Indian Space Research Organisation can be leveraged to accelerate OneWeb’s ambitions,” he added.Rajiv Sharma, the research head at SBICaps Securities, said: ""The deal could potentially catapult the Bharti Group to the big league in the global satellite communications space with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX Starlink and Amazon's Project Kuiper, although challenges remain in delivering affordable satellite broadband services in the absence of low-cost terminals.""He though added that Bharti's partnership with the UK government could prise open new revenue streams, as OneWeb was likely to participate in multiple government projects for delivering high-speed satellite broadband connectivity in rural markets around the world.OneWeb has estimated assets in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion and liabilities in the same range, according to US bankruptcy court filings.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76779581,imgsize-693236,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/bharti-uk-govt-team-bags-satellite-firm-oneweb-for-1-billion.jpg",ettechtech,"A consortium of India’s Bharti Enterprises and the UK government has won a bid to take over OneWeb , offering to invest $1 billion (Rs 7,465 crore) in the British firm that went bankrupt while trying to build a constellation of satellites to deliver wireless broadband globally.The two partners will invest $500 million each in OneWeb, which aims to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband services, especially in rural areas, and take on the likes of Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink and Jeff Bezos’s Amazon-linked Project Kuiper.The British government will take a significant equity share in OneWeb, UK business secretary Alok Sharma said in a statement.

"India’s aviation regulator has approved the Agriculture Ministry ’s request to operate drones at night and to use engine-powered drones rather than battery-operated ones in its fight against the spread of desert locusts in the western and central states.ET had reported on Monday that the ministry was seeking approvals for night operations of drones as locusts were most inactive after sunset, and for using fuel-powered drones which could remain airborne for longer and also carry heavier payloads than battery-operated models.India is the first country in the world to utilise drones in anti-locust operations, with the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) appreciating the government’s work in combating the spread of locusts by using latest technologies.“Congratulations to the agriculture ministry for receiving the approvals for night operation of drones and use of engine-powered drones with all-up weight upto 50 kg for anti-locust ops. This is the first such instance in India,” Amber Dubey, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation , wrote on a public forum.The approval from the Ministry of Civil Aviation comes a little over a month after the Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine and Storage (DPPQS), which comes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, was made the nodal agency for using drones in anti-locust operations.The latest clearance will allow the agri department to use drones weighing up to 50 kilogramme with its payload, as opposed to the earlier limit of 25 kg quadcopter restriction. These engine-powered drones will have three times the flight time and will be able to carry 60% more pesticides than those currently in operation.Currently, the agri department has 12 drones in operation across western and central states, with another 13 drones that will be put into service soon. The department has partnered with five drone providers and uses the vehicles to spray tops of trees and areas where tractor-based sprayers can’t access.However, drones will not replace ground-based sprayers that have been the primary way of controlling locusts across the world. The country is looking at a three-pronged approach of ground, aerial-based spraying using helicopters, apart from a small swarm of drones to aid pesticide spraying.“Drones are never going to substitute control by vehicles or aircraft, because you can cover much larger areas by vehicles or aircraft, and for much cheaper,” Keith Cressman, Senior Locust Forecasting Officer at the FAO, told ET. “But the advantage of using a drone for control is that you can treat some places that you might not be able to do otherwise - because the infestations are not large enough or because they’re in areas where vehicles cannot reach.”The use of drones in battling locusts could lead to increased reliance on unmanned aerial vehicles in India’s overall agriculture industry, multiple government officials told ET. While spraying pesticides is the most immediate use case, drones could soon help in crop mapping, crop analytics and yield improvement analytics.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76692662,imgsize-500200,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/dgca-allows-use-of-drones-at-night-to-ward-off-locusts.jpg",ettechtech,"India’s aviation regulator has approved the Agriculture Ministry ’s request to operate drones at night and to use engine-powered drones rather than battery-operated ones in its fight against the spread of desert locusts in the western and central states.ET had reported on Monday that the ministry was seeking approvals for night operations of drones as locusts were most inactive after sunset, and for using fuel-powered drones which could remain airborne for longer and also carry heavier payloads than battery-operated models.India is the first country in the world to utilise drones in anti-locust operations, with the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) appreciating the government’s work in combating the spread of locusts by using latest technologies.“Congratulations to the agriculture ministry for receiving the approvals for night operation of drones and use of engine-powered drones with all-up weight upto 50 kg for anti-locust ops.

"The Department of Agriculture is looking for drones that can fly at night and stay airborne for an extended duration, as it seeks to expand use of unmanned aerial vehicles to fight off locust swarms that have invaded India’s western and central region.The broad specification comes a little over one month after India’s civil aviation regulator granted the agriculture ministry conditional exemption to use drones in anti-locust operations, making India the first country to do so.It also comes ahead of the start of monsoon season in Rajasthan and surrounding regions, where desert locusts will migrate to over the next few weeks to breed and lay their eggs.Over the weekend, locust swarms descended upon Gurugram, with parts of Delhi also put on high alert.“Locusts are most inactive after sunset, so it makes sense to spray at night. We are also in talks with manufacturers who have drones that are powered by fuel, so they can stay airborne for a longer duration,” said Atish Chandra, Joint Secretary, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Department of Agriculture.The ministry of agriculture is currently processing the expanded list of requirements and it will seek permissions from the civil aviation ministry soon.Though a fairly small deployment, with just a dozen drones in operation and another dozen soon to be deployed, the agriculture department has found them to be invaluable in spraying the tops of tall trees and for their ability to reach inaccessible areas. Drones will, however, not replace traditional methods of locust control, which are still cheaper.The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which maintains an international watch on the spread of desert locusts, has praised India’s use of drones to control locust swarms, which pose a serious threat to the food security of nations.“It’s a little bit of exploration, because nobody knows how to control desert locusts safely and properly using drones, but India is a leader now and all the countries are going to learn from their experience,” Keith Cressman, Senior Locust Forecasting Officer at the FAO told ET. “We’re hoping, with this experience we can then develop some standardised operating procedures and some methodologies that all of the countries can follow.”The FAO has been working on ways to leverage drone technology to fight locusts for the past few years. However, with the Covid-19 pandemic disrupting international travel, the plans for experimental deployments have been delayed.Apart from the actual spraying of pesticide, drones will also be invaluable in tracking locusts, which can fly almost 150 kilometres a day, Cressman added.The agriculture department’s Chandra said drones had added a “new dimension” in the fight against desert locusts.While current exercises were extremely important to gather knowledge, the department is also planning to float a tender for industry participation soon after having learnt of the required specifications.Another senior government official, who did not wish to be named, said the exercise to use drones has been successful enough that it could become easier to get various government stakeholders to agree on broader use of drones in agriculture.“Locusts are sporadic, but lots of other pests require more cyclical and sustained spraying, which is what the industry is interested in,” the official added.India has seen some industry partners show interest, but governments will need to build their own drone capacity, like other anti-locust equipment, since large-scale locusts attacks are not a yearly affair.“Locusts are too unpredictable for the locust control to be good business. The industry has to partner with governments to develop technologies, but they shouldn’t look at it as a highly profitable exercise,” added Cressman. “At the end of the day, what are we doing by locust control? It’s providing food security, so industries must work with the authorities.”",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76681156,imgsize-188322,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/agriculture-ministry-eyes-drones-to-fight-off-locusts-swarms.jpg",ettechtech,"The Department of Agriculture is looking for drones that can fly at night and stay airborne for an extended duration, as it seeks to expand use of unmanned aerial vehicles to fight off locust swarms that have invaded India’s western and central region.The broad specification comes a little over one month after India’s civil aviation regulator granted the agriculture ministry conditional exemption to use drones in anti-locust operations, making India the first country to do so.It also comes ahead of the start of monsoon season in Rajasthan and surrounding regions, where desert locusts will migrate to over the next few weeks to breed and lay their eggs.Over the weekend, locust swarms descended upon Gurugram, with parts of Delhi also put on high alert.“Locusts are most inactive after sunset, so it makes sense to spray at night.

"A single corner store (kirana in Hindi) serves 100 Indians, yet three out of four of these mom-and-pop stores have no exposure to technology platforms for payments or procurement, according to a report by retail consulting firm Redseer Consulting, which was exclusively shared with ET.Even the 25% of these shops that do have some technology touchpoint – through the use of payment services like Google Pay, Paytm or Phonepe, and procurement platforms like Udaan , Metro Cash & Carry, and others, are deeply underpenetrated, the research firm said.After the Covid-19 virus outbreak further exposed India’s dependency on local businesses and the launch of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance JioMart, these 13 million corner shops have come to the centre stage of top technology businesses’ commerce play.Large technology companies, including Amazon, Flipkart, Udaan, Google, Swiggy, Pine Labs, as well as emerging businesses like Jumbotail, Khatabook, ShopX, Dunzo and Bounce, have moved fast to offer technology-backed sourcing, supply chain, financial services and value-added services to bolster digitisation at these corner stores, said the report.“Until now (prior to the pandemic), online commerce outweighed B2B digital story, but now the dynamics have changed,” Abhishek Chauhan, Associate Partner at Redseer Consulting told ET.The onset of the pandemic has also accelerated the willingness of small businesses to use technology to scale up operations, opening up a market that had in the past viewed technology companies as a competitor.About 80% of these shops are in small towns, and a majority of large businesses, including Flipkart and Udaan, are betting these smaller cities will drive the next phase of growth.“Partnering with kiranas enhances internet companies’ reach in smaller towns where the cost of owning last-mile delivery is high, while kiranas are already well penetrated,” Chauhan said.India’s retail sector is set to grow to $1.3 trillion by fiscal year 2025 from $1 trillion now. Unorganized retail will continue to be the dominant category, even as its share will fall to 77% from 84% in the next 5 years. In the FMCG and grocery category though, their contribution will continue to be almost 90%, the report said. Organized retail, both online and offline, is poised to grow from 16% to 22%, the report said.The dominance of corner stores in India is because of their footprint, locally relevant stock, perception among consumers that they are convenient and their personal relationship with shop owners. “These shops cannot be replaced...The only way to create a large business in the retail space is to enable these shops with technology to help them improve demand forecasting, inventory management and cut supply chain costs,” said Sujeet Kumar, cofounder of B2B marketplace Udaan.In the book-keeping space, Khatabook, which enables micro, small and medium merchants to track business transactions, said that it had seen over 8 million active merchants on the app.Last week, ET reported that Walmart-owned Flipkart was preparing to launch a separate business vertical for 90-minute delivery of goods from local stores. Amazon India also said a survey of 2,000 shops and sellers conducted by the etailer had indicated that 75% need to go online to get their revenues back given reduced footfalls.“Local shops can offer value-added services to nearby customers, and at the same time, listing on Amazon gives them access to national reach,” Gopal Pillai, Vice President, Amazon India Marketplace told ET.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76677397,imgsize-339811,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/technology-is-the-next-big-focus-of-13-million-kiranas.jpg",ettechtech,"A single corner store (kirana in Hindi) serves 100 Indians, yet three out of four of these mom-and-pop stores have no exposure to technology platforms for payments or procurement, according to a report by retail consulting firm Redseer Consulting, which was exclusively shared with ET.Even the 25% of these shops that do have some technology touchpoint – through the use of payment services like Google Pay, Paytm or Phonepe, and procurement platforms like Udaan , Metro Cash & Carry, and others, are deeply underpenetrated, the research firm said.After the Covid-19 virus outbreak further exposed India’s dependency on local businesses and the launch of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance JioMart, these 13 million corner shops have come to the centre stage of top technology businesses’ commerce play.Large technology companies, including Amazon, Flipkart, Udaan, Google, Swiggy, Pine Labs, as well as emerging businesses like Jumbotail, Khatabook, ShopX, Dunzo and Bounce, have moved fast to offer technology-backed sourcing, supply chain, financial services and value-added services to bolster digitisation at these corner stores, said the report.“Until now (prior to the pandemic), online commerce outweighed B2B digital story, but now the dynamics have changed,” Abhishek Chauhan, Associate Partner at Redseer Consulting told ET.The onset of the pandemic has also accelerated the willingness of small businesses to use technology to scale up operations, opening up a market that had in the past viewed technology companies as a competitor.About 80% of these shops are in small towns, and a majority of large businesses, including Flipkart and Udaan, are betting these smaller cities will drive the next phase of growth.“Partnering with kiranas enhances internet companies’ reach in smaller towns where the cost of owning last-mile delivery is high, while kiranas are already well penetrated,” Chauhan said.India’s retail sector is set to grow to $1.3 trillion by fiscal year 2025 from $1 trillion now.

"India has set up a new organisation to provide private enterprises a level playing field in building satellites and rockets and launch them using its space agency’s infrastructure.Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (In-Space) will hand-hold, promote and guide private industries in space activities through a friendly policy and regulatory environment, Union Minister of State for Space and Atomic Energy, Jitendra Singh said.In-Space will have members from the Space Commission as well as industry representatives on its board.Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) will focus more on building new technologies, human spaceflight programmes and deep space missions.

We have a roadmap,” he said.Sivan said the private industry is already involved in 80% of the production of satellites and rockets in India, largely as suppliers of systems. Isro is engaging the industry to manufacture its small satellite launch vehicle and polar satellite launch vehicle.Former Isro chairman G Madhavan Nair said the decision was a logical move to allow private firms in commercial space activities, while Isro focuses on building next generation rockets, satellites and deep space missions.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) in the United States also opened up to the private industry in stages and it has taken several decades for a competitive private sector to emerge there, he said.The government has had policies for over a decade that allow private companies to build satellites and use remote sensing applications. It, however, did not have policies for rockets as it was complying with the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ), even though India was not a signatory, and could not allow rockets with more capabilities.“The board now can look at this on a case-to-case basis,” Nair said.“If you look at Isro, programmes have grown more than 10-fold in the last decade or so, whereas the manpower remains the same, at around 15,000 people.

"New Delhi: The Supreme Court confirmed the government assessment of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues that telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea need to pay and reserved its order on how much time they’ll get to do so. The two companies offered to pay the money in 15 years while the government stood by its proposal to give them 20 years.The three-judge bench led by Justice Arun Mishra upheld the amount to be paid by Bharti Airtel at ₹25,976 crore and by Vodafone Idea at ₹50,399 crore, factoring in payments of ₹18,004 crore and ₹7,854 crore, respectively. This affirmed the government’s calculations and rejected lower assessments made by the companies themselves. The court didn’t say when it would issue the order on how much time the carriers would get to clear their dues, which include licence fees, spectrum usage charges (SUC), interest and penalties.The bench refused to countenance any representation from the telcos on reassessment of dues or excluding SUC of nearly ₹71,000 crore from the over ₹1.6 lakh crore liabilities.“Telcos are earning more than their pending dues,” Mishra said. “We won’t hear arguments for reassessment even for a second. We will impose exemplary costs on telcos. Why should we give relief to telcos behaving dishonestly on pending dues? Telcos are still challenging the AGR calculation by DoT (Department of Telecommunications).”Bharti Airtel shares closed 1.5% higher at ₹575.75 on the BSE Monday. Vodafone Idea was volatile during trade, closing 1.8% up at ₹9.04.The bench had said the government’s 20-year window was ""unrealistic"" and prodded the telcos to come up with a shorter timetable. It had suggested that they furnish securities, collateral and undertakings as guarantees. It had sought financial details of all telcos for the past 10 years after Vodafone Idea and others said they would find it difficult to pay the amounts sought.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, offered a 15-year repayment period. Tata Teleservices , through senior lawyers Arvind Datar and Ramji Srinivasan, sought seven to 10 years to pay its Rs 12,601crore dues, having already paid Rs 4,197 crore.Vodafone India, through Rohatgi, said that extraneous factors had wiped out equity of Rs 1 lakh crore. ""Whatever we earned was washed away in expenses,"" he said. The company had not set aside any amount for the AGR dues as it had won the case over this in the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal. ""Of the total revenue of Rs 6.27 trillion earned in the past 10 years, Rs 4.95 trillion has been spent on expenses."" Vodafone Idea wasn’t seeking any reassessment, only time to pay the money, he said.In response, the court said: ""We want to catch hold of you (Vodafone Idea). There’s so much liability on you. How should we catch hold of you?""As Rohatgi explained Vodafone Idea’s financial plight, the bench responded by saying: ""Who is the kingpin? Who is managing Vodafone Idea? You are showing such a black picture — how are we to see any light?""Since no bank would give any guarantees to the company at this juncture, Rohatgi offered goods and services tax (GST) credit of more than Rs 8,000 crore. ""The government can retain it.""Backing the government's 20-year repayment timeline, Mehta told the court that it was a ""well-thought-out decision aimed at preventing the economy from going haywire"".The bench questioned, ""What if someone goes into liquidation?"" Mehta replied, ""We can cancel their spectrum and auction the same.""Bharti Airtel contested the nearly Rs 44,000 crore figure, saying SUC dues of over Rs 21,000 crore can’t be part of AGR dues, but the government, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, rejected this claim. ""SUC is part of AGR dues,"" Mehta said. The Tata Teleservices balance amount is more than Rs 12,600 crore, he said. Senior advocate Datar contested this, saying the amount was Rs 9,000 crore and not Rs 16,000 crore, as claimed by the government. The bench shot down his plea. ""Tell us how you are going to secure the amount? You are wasting our time and energy on recalculations,"" Mishra said.Hughes Communication said it had already paid Rs 28.40 crore, leaving a balance of Rs 126 crore.Mehta said AGR dues worth nearly Rs 40,000 crore were due from telcos such as Videocon Telecommunications and Aircel, which are facing insolvency proceedings, as are Reliance Communications (RCom) and Sistema Shyam. The bench said it would examine the demand for a longer timeline for those in bankruptcy court. It sought details of companies that are facing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in seven days.""We need to ensure that the IBC is not being misused by companies to escape liabilities,"" Mishra said. ""We will examine the bona fides of RCom going into insolvency. He posted the pleas of these companies separately for hearing on August 10.During the proceedings, the bench made the court’s position clear on reassessment of AGR dues, addressing what it perceived to be some communication from the government on allowing recalculation.""Such big hands that are going against our orders — we will cut them short. You don’t know me, I will dispatch to jail from here,"" Mishra said.

"The examination of telcos' premium plans promising 4G network preference is among the ""top priorities"" for the regulator, and it hopes to finalise its views on the issue in about two weeks, a TRAI source said. On Friday, telecom tribunal TDSAT had stayed TRAI's recent order to Vodafone Idea , that had asked the company to withhold its offering promising priority 4G network on RedX plan.At the same time, Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) had said that it would be open for regulator TRAI to proceed with the inquiry and pass final orders in accordance with law at the earliest after ensuring that requirements of natural justice are satisfied and the Vodafone Idea (VIL) is given opportunity to explain any alleged contravention of regulator's directions.The TRAI source told that the examination of the plan will be among top priority for the regulator, which hopes to finalise its view on the issue in about two weeks. The source said that while much would depend on the extent of data and information that TRAI gets from operators like VIL and Bharti Airtel (whose similar plan also came under scrutiny), the regulator would strive to finalise its view at the ""earliest possible"" timeframe.Vodafone Idea had last week approached the telecom tribunal against the sector regulator's letter to the company asking it to withhold its plan that promised better speeds to certain priority users. In fact, TRAI had questioned both VIL and Bharti Airtel on whether network preference to specific customers came at the cost of deterioration of services for other non-premium subscribers.TRAI had asked Vodafone Idea how the company is ensuring service quality to non-RedX data users, when the network priority had been promised to RedX customers, especially as telecom networks are reportedly congested in the pandemic scenario. It asked the operator if providing priority to some, not affect the service quality of rest of the network, since no additional capacity is being created.It had asked after the launch of RedX plan, how would other non-premium customers check or raise concerns on deterioration of service quality, since neither average data speed nor minimum download speed has been committed to a 4G user at present.In its questionnaire sent earlier this month to the company, TRAI also reminded VIL how the company and other telecom operators had argued time and again that for mobile networks, the data throughput to a user at a particular location depends on multitude of factors like number of subscribers using data services, device quality and external interferences and other such elements.TRAI asked what assurances are being given to protect the interest of non-premium users.The regulator has also inquired if RedX customers will have better network experience, such as higher 4G speeds at the cost of deterioration of service offerings to a large number of non Red X customers who may suffer further. It had asked the company to provide data to support its arguments.TRAI had also asked the company to explain the term 'priority on network' for RedX customers, and if with respect to data services, there was any performance or experience commitment to such customers or resource reservation to ensure better data service. It asked how such customers will make informed choice and ensure that service obligations have successfully been discharged by VIL.TRAI asked if any verifiable network or service parameter is being committed to RedX subscribers, and the definite advantage such customers are likely to get in lieu of higher monthly committent.Following the latest TDSAT order, Vodafone Idea is free to continue onboarding new subscribers to the RedX plan that had initially talked of faster data speeds, but in May was modified to promise of a ""priority 4G network on RedX Plan as compared to other Vodafone post paid plans"".At Rs 1099 per month (revised rental), it is at a substantial premium to VIL's Q4FY20 average revenue per user (ARPU) of Rs 121.An e-mail sent to Vodafone Idea seeking its stance to TRAI's questionnaire did not elicit a response.RedX comes bundled with benefits including ISD calls at special rates, unlimited data, premier customer service, international roaming, and free one-year subscriptions to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5 and Vodafone Play streaming services.RedX plan comes with a minimum subscription period of six months, failing which customers would be charged an early exit fee of Rs 3,000.In its FAQs for the tariff plan on its website, Vodafone Idea said, ""Speed is dependent on a variety of factors like i) handset, ii) network congestion, iii) location of access, iv) topography, v) barriers caused by constructions etc. Hence, no mobile network can commit a minimum speed. However, you will have a better experience most of the time than other customers in the same location and using similar handsets but who are not on this plan.""",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-77067730,imgsize-83878,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettelecom/preference-plan-probe-among-top-priorities-hope-to-finalise-views-in-2-weeks-trai-source.jpg",cio_etc_telecom,"The examination of telcos' premium plans promising 4G network preference is among the ""top priorities"" for the regulator, and it hopes to finalise its views on the issue in about two weeks, a TRAI source said.

Number crunch post Jio’s entry in 2016

The trail of dwindling revenues and losses had already started after 2016 for the surviving players post Mukesh Ambani owned Jio’s entry.

Vodafone Idea Ltd (Idea): In its 2017-18 annual report, the telco reported a decline of 20.2% in its total revenues over the previous year (FY17) on a consolidated basis. The EBITDA figure reflected a decrease of 39.3% year-on-year and the consolidated net loss stood at Rs 41,682 million vis-à-vis Rs 3,997 million for the previous year (FY17).

Airtel: During the same period (FY 17-18), Airtel recorded a 12.3% fall in its revenues over the last year (FY17) while net profit for the year declined by 48.5% year-on-year. The grim position that these numbers indicated had ostensibly been due to a combination of factors like TRAI’s slashing of IUC rates in September 2017, high spectrum costs in addition to the Jio effect. Further, falling subscriber counts continued as customers ported to Jio’s network which offered almost zero payment services. Of private operators, Vodafone Idea has seen the biggest subscribers' loss over the past year.

"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel is likely to replace Huawei with Sweden’s Ericsson for 4G network expansion and modernisation in the Rest of Tamil Nadu (RoTN) circle, people familiar with the matter said, as the Sunil Mittal-led telco takes gradual steps towards reducing dependency on the Chinese telecom gear maker.“Without Rest of Tamil Nadu, Huawei will just have two Airtel circles. Airtel has already stopped giving packet core orders to Huawei for any capacity expansion,” a person said on condition of anonymity. “All such orders have gone to Ericsson.”Ericsson, which is the second-largest vendor for Airtel, declined to comment. Queries sent to Huawei remained unanswered.""Airtel has strong relationships with several partners. These partners work across all our domains, radio, core and transport,” an Airtel spokesperson said in a statement to ET.Huawei had increased its involvement with the Airtel network in 2017 when it got Rajasthan and UP (West) on top of Karnataka and Rest of Tamil Nadu.But it is now likely to be back to two, with the telecom major, with over 284 million users, in late 2019 having swapped Huawei’s gear with Ericsson’s in the Rajasthan circle. That came at a time when the pressure on Huawei was increasing, mainly from the US, for its alleged proximity to the Chinese government, leading to concerns over possible snooping.And now, India too has made its security concerns around Huawei clear, especially in the wake of the heightened border tensions with China. New Delhi has already barred state-run carriers from sourcing equipment from Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE , and is believed to have informally nudged private telcos to replace Chinese equipment over time, without disrupting consumer services. Besides the US, even the UK recently banned the purchase of Huawei 5G equipment and said any such gear that’s installed needs to be removed by 2027.Randeep Sekhon, chief technology officer at Bharti Airtel, previously told ET that alternative suppliers were available if needed. “We will be fully compliant with government orders… To be fair, there are enough suppliers in the world and new suppliers are coming in. India should be fine with it.”The comments had come soon after the US tightened restrictions on the Chinese vendor, which meant that Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the world’s largest contract semiconductor maker, had to stop taking new orders from Huawei. This is expected to affect Huawei’s supplies globally, including to Indian vendors.Coinciding with the pressure on Huawei, Ericsson has become more aggressive in the market.“Ericsson is getting aggressive with its pricing and is being looked like the true alternative, having provided previous-generation technologies,” the person said, adding that the next step for Airtel is to explore similar possibilities in remaining two Huawei circles.Airtel has recently renegotiated its 4G network deal with Finland’s Nokia in nine circles to supply equipment till 2022. With the likely new deal, Ericsson could be supplying gear in eight circles, Huawei would be down to two and China’s ZTE would be at three.Airtel though hasn’t moved yet on replacing ZTE, with the focus primarily on Huawei. ZTE supplies equipment to Airtel in Punjab, Haryana, and Kolkata.""Any uncertainty in future supply of equipment from Chinese vendors like Huawei will hurt telecom users of that equipment. It is natural telcos would want to mitigate the risk,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at telecom consultancy firm ComFirst. ""How long will it take and what cost would it entail is something that would be on top of mind of companies given poor financial health of the sector.”""After the recent global decisions from the US and now the UK, Airtel would definitely be wanting to reduce dependence on Chinese vendors. Especially when its competitor has zero dependence on Chinese vendors,"" said Rohan Dhamija, head of Middle East and India (South Asia) at Analysys Mason.Even Vodafone Idea is believed to have become jittery about sourcing equipment from Huawei, but will find it tougher to replace the Chinese vendors, having signed multi-year deals as recently as 2018 after Vodafone India and Idea Cellular merged, industry executives said.In fact, the two Chinese vendors had increased their share of the total pie, contributing 35% of the telco’s total network requirements with 65% going to the two European vendors, compared with a 20:80 ratio earlier. Nokia currently provides networks equipment to the combined Vodafone-Idea Cellular entity in nine circles, followed by Ericsson in eight circles.

"New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm has taken a contradictory stand to Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel on the issue of international roaming tariffs, further underlining spreading the fault lines in the industry . While Jio has told the sector regulator that carriers who are offering extremely divergent standard rates versus pack tariffs for international mobile roaming ( IMR ) services must be pushed to rationalise this structure, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel rejected any such need, saying this was in consumers’ interest.But all three telcos rejected the idea of any regulation on international tariffs and asked the authority not to intervene in the complex IMR tariff construct which involves bulk tariff negotiations with multiple foreign operators.The issue at hand is that telcos, for instance, offer a standard rate of Rs 180 per minute for making a call from USA to India, whereas the one-day pack with unlimited incoming calls and 100 minutes of calls to India is being offered at Rs 575. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) had floated a consultation paper on IMR services to ask the carriers about the rationale behind this vast gap, among various other issues causing bill shocks to international roamers.Vodafone Idea, in its response to the paper, said that these charges “have strong economic/commercial rationale to merit such a distinction” as they are offered to suit the usage needs of different types of customers. “In case of prepaid customers, out of actual roamers, 80% are on standard rates and only 20% are on IR packs,” the telco said.On its part, Bharti Airtel said that under its ‘Roam without fear’ feature, the telco bars data usage whenever a customer exceeds his daily pack limit to prevent accidental usage, while others you use below the limit pay as per standard rates. Thus, “rationalisation of standard rates doesn’t impact the customers as they are already protected by us”.As per analyst estimates, Jio's revenues from international roaming are less than half of that of Airtel and Vodafone Idea.In the paper, Trai was also concerned about automatic activation of roaming because background data usage by installed apps may cause bill shock to users who are not using the phone actively in a foreign land.Bharti Airtel recommended that IMR service can be kept inactive for postpaid SIMs as these customers check their usage after the bill is generated and are prone to bill shocks, but not for prepaid SIMs where a user pre-pays an amount, according to the subscribed pack of their choice.Jio said it keeps such service inactive for all users until requested by the user or selection of an IR pack whereas Vodafone Idea said it does so only for its postpaid users and no mandate is required for prepaid SIMs.Trai had also asked whether the IMR tariff be counted on 24-hour format at first instance of using voice/data/SMS service by a customer rather than a calendar-day format.

"Patna: Data is a nation's asset and it should be utilised properly for achieving prosperity, especially in sectors like healthcare, agriculture and education, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Saturday.

Number crunch post Jio’s entry in 2016

The trail of dwindling revenues and losses had already started after 2016 for the surviving players post Mukesh Ambani owned Jio’s entry.

Vodafone Idea Ltd (Idea): In its 2017-18 annual report, the telco reported a decline of 20.2% in its total revenues over the previous year (FY17) on a consolidated basis. The EBITDA figure reflected a decrease of 39.3% year-on-year and the consolidated net loss stood at Rs 41,682 million vis-à-vis Rs 3,997 million for the previous year (FY17).

Airtel: During the same period (FY 17-18), Airtel recorded a 12.3% fall in its revenues over the last year (FY17) while net profit for the year declined by 48.5% year-on-year. The grim position that these numbers indicated had ostensibly been due to a combination of factors like TRAI’s slashing of IUC rates in September 2017, high spectrum costs in addition to the Jio effect. Further, falling subscriber counts continued as customers ported to Jio’s network which offered almost zero payment services. Of private operators, Vodafone Idea has seen the biggest subscribers' loss over the past year. The telco has lost almost 60 million subscribers between September 2018 and August 2019 while Airtel lost just 15.77 million with Jio gaining nearly 96 million in the same period.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-77037691,imgsize-34547,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettelecom/vodafone-idea-pays-rs-1000-crore-more-to-dot-towards-agr-dues.jpg",cio_etc_telecom,"4 of 10

"NEW DELHI: Apple Inc assembly partner Pegatron Corp is making preparations for its first plant in India, adding to a large influx of foreign tech investments in the country this year.In June, the Indian government set out a $6.6 billion plan to woo the world’s top smartphone manufacturers, offering financial incentives and ready-to-use manufacturing clusters. Pegatron is now setting up a local subsidiary and joining fellow Taiwanese electronics assemblers Foxconn Technology Group and Wistron Corp, who have already been making some iPhone handsets in southern India.With a number of factories in China, Pegatron is the second-largest iPhone assembler and depends on Apple for more than half of its business. Like its peers, it will set up in the south of India, according to a person familiar with its plans who asked not to be named. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, and Wistron are looking to expand their operations in the country, and Pegatron’s entry can be seen as a defensive move to protect its share of budget iPhone manufacturing, according to Matthew Kanterman of Bloomberg Intelligence.Pegatron could uphold its iPhone SE assembly market share, which may have grown from a 50-50 split with Hon Hai: Matthew Kanterman, analystIndia has seen a surge of inward investment in recent weeks, with Google, Facebook Inc and others pouring close to $20 billion into Jio Platforms Ltd, billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s mobile internet venture. Google has committed to spending $10 billion over the next five to seven years to hasten India’s digital transition and Amazon.com Inc has said it intends to export $10 billion of made-in-India goods by 2025. When Jeff Bezos visited the country in January, he said, “The 21st century is going to be the Indian century.”The country offers a vast pool of skilled labor as well as a domestic market of a billion mobile connections. Only about half of those are smartphones, however, leaving untapped potential that is attractive to growth-hungry global brands like Apple, Samsung Electronics Co, Xiaomi Corp and Oppo. For assemblers like Pegatron, exports would also be an enticing opportunity, especially at a time of worsening trade relations between Washington and Beijing making it imperative to have a diverse geographic base.Smartphones are a focal point for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s much-touted Make in India program. Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s minister for information technology and electronics, has said the goal is for brands and manufacturers to transport the entire supply chain to the country, not just the end-stage assembly. Quoted by local media, Prasad said India wants not only the “bridegroom” but also the “wedding procession.”India will become a global manufacturing hub for both components and the complete assembly of smartphones and other devices , said Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the Indian Cellular & Electronics Association. The group’s three dozen members include Apple, Foxconn, Google, Wistron, Oppo and others.“The focus is shifting from making for India to exports and the $400 billion electronics manufacturing that India is targeting by 2025 will be dominated by exports,” Mohindroo said via phone from New Delhi.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-77029384,imgsize-234203,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettelecom/apple-iphone-assembler-joins-wave-of-tech-investment-in-india.jpg",cio_etc_telecom,"NEW DELHI: Apple Inc assembly partner Pegatron Corp is making preparations for its first plant in India, adding to a large influx of foreign tech investments in the country this year.In June, the Indian government set out a $6.6 billion plan to woo the world’s top smartphone manufacturers, offering financial incentives and ready-to-use manufacturing clusters.

"New Delhi: Smartphone shipments in India fell a massive 48% in April-June quarter to 17.3 million units due to nationwide shutdown until mid-May, Canalys said. This is the first set of data for the Covid-hit April-June period for smartphones Smartphone vendors faced a diabolical situation, dealing with both low supply due to a complete halt in production and diminished demand, as online and offline retailers were prohibited from selling smartphones, the market agency said.As local production suffered through the early stages of Q2, vendors like Xiaomi and Oppo imported smartphones to meet pent-up demand.""It’s been a rocky road to recovery for the smartphone market in India,” said Canalys Analyst Madhumita Chaudhary.""While vendors witnessed a crest in sales as soon as markets opened, production facilities struggled with staffing shortages on top of new regulations around manufacturing, resulting in lower production output. The fluidity of the lockdown situation across India has had a deep-rooted effect on vendors’ go-to-market strategies."" Apple was the least impacted among the top-10 vendors as shipments fell just 20% year-on-year to just over 250,000 in Q2 2020, Canalys said.Xiaomi and Vivo have undertaken an O2O (offline-to-online) strategy to support their massive offline network.Online channels, too, while seeing a positive effect of the pandemic on market share, have seen sales decline considerably.”Xiaomi was the market leader in India, capturing 31% of overall market share, shipping 5.3 million smartphone units in the quarter.Vivo maintained the second position, shipping 3.7 million units, and grew its market share to 21.3% from 19.9% in Q1 2020. Samsung was third, with 2.9 million smartphones shipped, and also saw exports impacted as its largest manufacturing plant outside of Vietnam shut down for most of Q2.Oppo edged out Realme to take the fourth position as it shipped 2.2 million units, compared to Realme’s 1.7 million.“Luck is not on the side of the Chinese vendors. There has been public anger directed towards China. The combinations of this and the recently announced ‘Aatmanirbhar’ (self-sufficient) initiatives by the government have pushed Chinese smartphone vendors into the eye of the public storm,"" Saud Canalys Research Analyst Adwait Mardikar.Canalys estimates that over 96% of all smartphones sold in India in 2019 were manufactured/assembled locally.“Vendors are driving the message of ‘Made in India’ to consumers and are eager to position their brand as ‘India-first.’ Despite the sentiment, the effect on Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Realme is likely to be minimal, as alternatives by Samsung, Nokia , or even Apple are hardly price-competitive,” added Mardikar.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-77024182,imgsize-456840,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettelecom/pandemic-nearly-halves-india-smartphone-shipments-in-june-quarter-samsung-most-impacted-report.jpg",cio_etc_telecom,"New Delhi: Smartphone shipments in India fell a massive 48% in April-June quarter to 17.3 million units due to nationwide shutdown until mid-May, Canalys said.

"The ban on Chinese apps , especially popular ones like ByteDance’s TikTok and Helo, is resulting in a windfall for US social media giants like Instagram Facebook and YouTube Since the government banned 59 Chinese apps on June 30, the average daily time spent on Instagram has more than doubled (up 2.3 times), and Facebook has also seen a significant jump in the time spent on the platform.Interestingly, the time being spent by Indians on social media and video apps in a day has not come down by a large degree, indicating that users have jumped ship and have switched over to new platforms, according to a study by online insights measurement company Kantar.Giving details about the digital behaviour pattern of online users since the ban on Chinese apps, Kantar’s Web Audience Measurement (WAM) panel showed that the US-based internet companies have managed to regain market share that they had been losing due to the fast-paced growth and popularity of the Chinese apps, especially TikTok.“Given that users were spending hours every week across these (Chinese) platforms, one would have expected to see a dip in the overall time spent online once these platforms were no longer accessible. However, the average time spent dropped only marginally — by 6% — from 6 hours 37 minutes to 6 hours 15 minutes, indicating that consumers are switching over to rival platforms much faster than anticipated,” the analysis showed.For Instagram and Facebook, gains were almost immediate.

"It’s been about three weeks since the government banned 59 Chinese apps including popular short video platform TikTok and social media service Helo, both owned by Bytedance.As expected, a crush of local startups, products from bigger tech companies and resurgent incumbents like ShareChat are pushing to get a slice of what’s estimated to be a 100-120 million daily active users who are up for grabs. ET also reported about the rise of a few Chinese apps like Snack Video that have rushed in to take advantage of the situation.But risk investors are divided about backing these apps. While Nexus Venture Partners is learnt to be leading a $5-million financing round in Indian social and short video app Mitron TV, some other venture firms are learnt to have seen and passed some of these newbies like Chingari among others.While these investors want to back companies that can seize the void left by the banned apps, they want to wait-and-watch for now, according to people who are keenly tracking the segment. Others also talk about how monetisation is still a far cry for apps as India is still a user-led story, unlike in China.To put things into perspective, Bytedance, as per a Reuters report, saw its revenue soar more than 130% year on year to around $5.6 billion for January-March 2020, while Bloomberg reported that the company drew over $3 billion in net profit last year on revenues of over $17 billion. Industry estimates say Bytedance’s India revenue could be $4-5 million per month.I spoke to a few people who have closely watched the short-video and social space evolve in India and in China to break down the noise and understand what will emerge out of this situation.Anu Hariharan, Partner with YC Continuity Fund, is someone who knows Bytedance well. In 2017 she wrote a fabulous blog post —The Hidden Forces Behind Toutiao: China’s Content King—which brought the Chinese tech company into prominence in Silicon Valley and worldwide.Founded in 2012 in Beijing, Bytedance began life with Toutiao, a new aggregator. Hariharan’s blog post three years ago, brought the Chinese tech company into prominence in Silicon Valley and worldwide. “TikTok started off by catering to teens, school kids, and then scaled its demographics. What worked for TikTok is personalisation of content. Also 30% creators attracted 70-80% engagement on its platforms. As always supply goes to where the demand is-- at the end of the day the product that attracts most demand will get these creators…” she says while talking about whether existing players will gain on the back of the ban.Hariharan adds, “India has seen an acceleration of people coming online over the last few years with Jio offering cheaper mobile data and monthly active users ( MAUs), daily active users ( DAUs) going up. There has been some improvement in monetisation but India is still a user story, so making money will take time. Look at Facebook, Snapchat-- they all have big user bases but India is not a high revenue market and that will take time. Till the GDP per capita increases, monetisation will not be exponential. It is the same story if you look at other sectors like the average order value for food-delivery in India is the smallest-- even compared to its Asian peers…""TikTok racked up 600 million installs in India and the user engagement was never-seen-before at more than 40 minutes per day.“Bytedance cultivated an ecosystem of creators and users which is now looking for a new platform,” says an investor in a venture capital fund who has been following social apps in India and China. “It would have been easy to migrate wholesale to a new platform had the matching (content to user taste) been easy. But reality is, it is a very tough problem. The newbies today don't have the technology (AI) to solve the matching problem...”Several new apps are seeing rapid increase in downloads, but most in the industry feel this unhindered rise won’t be sustainable.Some of the gainers include ShareChat’s Moj, MX Player’s TakaTak, Dailyhunt’s Josh, and InMobi’s Roposo. MX Player is owned by Times Internet, a part of the Times of India group, which also publishes this newspaper.“The TikTok playbook combined all of the following to work seamlessly—easy-to-use video creation tools, deep engagement with influencers, world class AI algorithm, massive and simultaneous capital investments, and tech infrastructure that allowed for a smooth video experience,” says Tarun Davda, managing director at early stage VC firm Matrix Partners India.Davda thinks the recent ban of Chinese apps offers a large opportunity for developers who can match their quality. “TikTok’s brand partnerships showed that monetisation is sure to follow if someone can recreate that playbook for Bharat,” said Davda who took bets on startups like short video app Clip in 2018. However, with larger companies like Instagram, Dailyhunt and Gaana throwing their hat in the ring, “a simple copy-TikTok strategy isn’t going to work”, he adds.In 2018, we wrote about how Chinese products had been able to make inroads into India markets beyond the top cities where American peers had not been able to go deep. Helo, Vigo Video (now shut), Bigo Live and Likee, were together spending millions of dollars to propel a market which started taking shape with the help of cheap mobile data.These Chinese apps had been able to address India-2 better because back home in China they launched in Tier-II cities and worked their way up the demographic ladder.People who have followed China tech said they understood the nuances of tier-II user behaviour better, some of which they have been able to transplant to India. “Their aggression, when it comes to spending $10 million or so in marketing on a monthly basis without making a dime, is difficult for others to pull off,” says an investor at a venture fund.Another venture capitalist who is looking to back one of the Indian social startups says he expects a few meaningful platforms to emerge as a result of the Chinese apps being banned. “Players like Instagram will be unable to connect with audiences in smaller cities and hinterlands…Instagram is still an aspirational platform for the Tier-1 market,” he says. “While a TikTok clone is not the answer, there will be short-video-led categories across communities,” he adds optimistically.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-77055824,imgsize-1861897,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/as-companies-chase-the-short-video-gold-rush-monetisation-remains-elusive.jpg",ettechmobile,"It’s been about three weeks since the government banned 59 Chinese apps including popular short video platform TikTok and social media service Helo, both owned by Bytedance.As expected, a crush of local startups, products from bigger tech companies and resurgent incumbents like ShareChat are pushing to get a slice of what’s estimated to be a 100-120 million daily active users who are up for grabs.

"A top White House adviser on Thursday said he expects TikTok to separate from its Chinese owner and operate as an US company, amid growing concerns about the security of the data handled by the short video app.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters a move by TikTok to leave Beijing ByteDance Technology, would be a better option than a ban on the app, which was threatened by State Department Secretary Mike Pompeo earlier this month.“We haven’t made final decisions but... I think TikTok is going to pull out of the holding company which is China-run and operate as an independent American company,” Kudlow said. He did not specify whether TikTok’s ownership would change under the proposed structure. He declined to comment when asked if US companies could acquire TikTok.When asked about Kudlow’s remarks, a TikTok spokesman said the company would not “engage with speculation in the market,” and referred to a statement last week noting that ByteDance was “evaluating changes to the corporate structure of its TikTok business” and fully committed to protecting users privacy and security.Kudlow’s comments come as TikTok finds itself increasingly in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with US-China relations strained by the coronavirus pandemic and Beijing’s move to curb freedoms in Hong Kong. President Donald Trump ’s chief of staff said on Wednesday that the administration is studying the national security risks of social media applications including TikTok and WeChat, with action to address the issue expected in the coming weeks, a White House official.On Wednesday, the New York Times reported the administration was weighing action against Chinese social media services like TikTok under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president broad powers to penalise companies in response to extraordinary threats, citing people familiar with the matter.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-77030262,imgsize-218024,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/us-expects-tiktok-to-operate-as-local-company-leave-bytedance.jpg",ettechmobile,"A top White House adviser on Thursday said he expects TikTok to separate from its Chinese owner and operate as an US company, amid growing concerns about the security of the data handled by the short video app.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters a move by TikTok to leave Beijing ByteDance Technology, would be a better option than a ban on the app, which was threatened by State Department Secretary Mike Pompeo earlier this month.“We haven’t made final decisions but...

By Saritha Rai

In late June, when India banned 59 Chinese apps, including global sensation TikTok , the short-video platform stopped working for its 200 million local users. Within hours, an avalanche of new sign-ups pushed the servers of one of its Bangalore-based rivals, Roposo , to breaking point.Two weeks on, Roposo, which also offers short videos , says it’s peaking at 500,000 new users an hour and expects to have 100 million by month’s end. That’s almost double the 55 million it had before the ban, and puts Roposo among a profusion of Indian startups to benefit from TikTok’s troubles in the country.The ban from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government covered other big Chinese names such as Alibaba Group’s UC Web mobile browser and Tencent's WeChat messaging app, and came amid a brutal border face-off between India and China that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.While India cited privacy and security concerns, the restrictions are poised to dramatically alter the competitive landscape in the nation’s digital economy. They give local firms a fighting chance at winning a larger chunk of the country’s more than half-a-billion internet denizens. And they could pave the way for some Indian firms to compete more aggressively with global giants such as Amazon and Facebook , who are also seeking to profit from one of the world’s largest digital booms.“It was a rocket ship instant for the country’s app startups,” said Naveen Tewari, founder of the startup that owns Roposo, munching nuts against the backdrop of the red-brick-walled study in his Bangalore home on a recent Zoom call. “We have a viable chance to become the world’s fourth technology hub after the U.S., China and Russia.”His decade-old digital advertising startup InMobi, Roposo’s parent, has in earlier years drawn investments from global names such as SoftBank Group . Last year, PayPal co-founder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel backed its unit, Glance, which acquired Roposo in November.Roposo features videos showcasing moves set to Bollywood music, humor minus the ribaldry, pranks, fashion and even jokes about the coronavirus pandemic. Roposo, as Tewari put it, is the app you won’t be embarrassed to show your mom.TikTok has faced censure from courts, women’s groups, users and governments for content seen as sexually explicit or for the depiction of events like acid attacks on women. Roposo and other Indian TikTok imitators, on the other hand, market their content as fun that’s more in line with India’s relatively conservative culture.TikTok didn’t respond to requests for comment for this story. In a June 30 statement, it said it was invited to meet government stakeholders to provide clarifications, and has and will continue to comply with security and data privacy requirements under Indian law.The Chinese app has in the past emphasized its efforts to moderate content and said its policies don’t permit videos that risk people’s safety, promote physical harm or glorify violence against women. Earlier this year, it suspended the account of a prominent content creator for posting a mock acid attack video.Many Indian apps have a late start, and most lack the sophistication and user-friendly interfaces of TikTok. Nor do they have the investment appetite and the deep pockets of the likes of TikTok parent Bytedance Ltd., which is the world’s most valuable startup and was valued at more than $100 billion in May.Still, the Indian government’s ban throws open multiple, billion user business models, said Manjunath Bhat, a senior director analyst at Gartner “India’s entrepreneurs didn’t lack talent, they were just short on ambition,” Bhat said. “The combined effect of the coronavirus lockdown and the app ban presents a never-before, never-again opportunity.”With Indian names like Chingari (Hindi for spark), Mitron (meaning friends) and Bolo Indya (Tell me, India), a string of small Indian TikTok challengers, have been notching up titanic user numbers since the ban on the Chinese apps. Some like the Moj app are barely weeks old.Battlers in other categories have also received a windfall as other Chinese names like highly-downloaded image scanner CamScanner were also blocked. The new contenders from a variety of categories have three themes in common. Their apps are made in India. Their data is stored in India. Their content, mainly in regional languages, is attuned to local sensibilities.The followers of an Indian spiritual guru, Sri Sri Ravishankar, created Elyments, an all-in-one rival for WhatsApp , Facebook and Instagram . Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, of the Reliance conglomerate, launched JioMeet , a video conferencing rival to the popular San Jose-based Zoom.Sumit Ghosh, cofounder of Chingari, says many of the China short video apps have adult content designed to grab attention and ensure they go viral. “In contrast, our algorithms are built to ensure trash will never trend on Chingari,” said Ghosh. Its videos are slow-dripped to users to check for offensive content. If multiple users complain, videos are pulled off.Ghosh and his cofounder began building the app just over a year ago when data consumption started exploding. It catered to Indians in smaller towns who hungered for relatable, Indian language content. In the months that followed, the founders closely matched TikTok, feature for feature, adding everything from livestreams to AR filters, the computer-generated special effects that users can layer over real-life video and images.Bangalore-based Chingari, which had 3.5 million users on the day of the ban, says it has crossed 17.5 million. Its overwhelmed founders are now creating a company, Chingari Media Pvt. They are drawing up a corporate and equity structure, testing revenue strategies and growing their eight-engineer team.TikTok influencers – stars with huge following who market products and services - are popping up by the thousands on Ghosh’s Twitter asking to be on Chingari as verified users. He says his startup is in “late funding talks”.In New Delhi, Trisha Girdhar’s influencer management agency could portend the future. Until last month, TikTok accounted for the bulk of her earnings. Now, the 22-year-old is now straining to shift her star clients - influencers from far-flung towns like Akola, Nabha, Katni and Birati - to Roposo and other platforms. “Brands are looking seriously at our influencers,” said Girdhar who herself specializes in belly dancing videos and has a fan following on Roposo.Roposo itself is getting a deluge of influencer marketing agencies and celebrities wanting to come aboard. It’s discussing contracts with celebrity users and content creators. It’s investing in camera filters and Indian themes. “This isn’t an opportunity just for entrepreneurs,” said Tewari. “Investors ought to be rushing over.”",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76975728,imgsize-100285,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/tiktok-s-india-rival-booms-with-500-000-users-added-every-hour.jpg",ettechmobile,"By Saritha Rai

"Chinese companies such as TikTok-owner ByteDance have been asked by India to answer 77 questions about their apps that have been banned by New Delhi, including whether they censored content, worked on behalf of foreign governments or lobbied influencers.India's Information Technology Ministry has given the companies three weeks to respond to the questionnaire, which has been seen by Reuters, and said unspecified follow-up action would be taken, two sources said.India last month banned the apps following a border clash between soldiers from the two countries, which left 20 Indian soldiers dead. India has said the apps pose a threat to its ""sovereignty and integrity"". China has criticised the ban.The 59 banned apps, which include TikTok and Alibaba's UC Browser, were asked whether they acted at the behest of any foreign government to edit, promote or demote any content.One theme of the questionnaire is whether content was censored after an attack last year carried out by a Pakistan-based militant group in Pulwama district in Kashmir. The attack killed at least 40 Indian police officers and heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.""In the aftermath of the Pulwama Attack of 2019, did the company/app censor content relating to the attack or its perpetrators?"" the question reads.TikTok said it was working to respond to the ministry's queries and that it complied with all Indian laws, adding that users' data security and privacy were its top priorities.The app ban has jolted the ambitions of ByteDance in India, where its TikTok video app was hugely popular. Neither Alibaba nor the Indian ministry responded to requests for comment.A source familiar with the government's thinking said the queries were in line with federal procedures and the same questions were sent to all affected companies.One question seeks to investigate if company executives in India communicated with film stars, social media influencers or journalists to promote any content, even if the communication was not for commercial purposes.Other queries were around advertisers, business structures, taxation practices and privacy policies, the document showed.The government also asked the app companies whether they had faced any investigation in the United States, European Union or elsewhere for surreptitiously harvesting user data.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76970565,imgsize-474468,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/after-ban-india-asks-chinese-app-makers-to-answer-77-questions-on-security-content.jpg",ettechmobile,"Chinese companies such as TikTok-owner ByteDance have been asked by India to answer 77 questions about their apps that have been banned by New Delhi, including whether they censored content, worked on behalf of foreign governments or lobbied influencers.India's Information Technology Ministry has given the companies three weeks to respond to the questionnaire, which has been seen by Reuters, and said unspecified follow-up action would be taken, two sources said.India last month banned the apps following a border clash between soldiers from the two countries, which left 20 Indian soldiers dead.

The Reserve Bank of India has set up a high-level committee to study the use of Quick Response (QR) codes to process contactless transactions in light of the ongoing Covid-19 situation, three people aware of the matter told ET, and the panel is in the final stage of submitting its report.

The committee – comprising academicians, scientists and industry executives -- has been asked to figure out the economics of QR deployment at merchant locations, the benefits of having an interoperable and open-loop system as well as recommend guidelines for standardising deployments, they said.

Professor Deepak Pathak of IIT Bombay heads the six-member panel.

Former Punjab National Bank CEO Sunil Mehta, NPCI CEO Dilip Asbe, CC Avenues CEO Vishwas Patel, Director of the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology DRBT A S Ramasastri, and Arvind Kumar, scientist at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), are its other members.

RBI did not respond to ET’s email.

“There are concerns in the ecosystem, flagged at RBI, that some companies are using their own closed-loop system for payment processing, which is against the spirit of innovation and broader ecosystem expansion,” said a banker aware of the matter who did not want to be identified.

The committee is in final stages of submitting its report, the person added.

A closed-loop QR system only accepts payments from the mobile application of its deployer. This is against the principle of interoperability agreement between third-party payment applications and banks that governs the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) ecosystem.

Furthermore, payment companies and banks are now also using QR technology for the acceptance of contactless card payments using Bharat QR, which is a mutually derived solution among NPCI, Visa and Mastercard to pay bills without sharing credentials to merchants.

The increased impetus among ecosystem players to rely on cheaper QR technology to accept contactless transactions comes at a time when the government is gradually easing lockdown restrictions in phases across the country.

The option of providing contactless payment facilities for consumers could also be made mandatory for several categories of merchants, which could further necessitate a standardised protocol for companies deploying these stickers, experts said.

Another challenge is to increase awareness among rural merchants and customers where the use of QR stickers is fast catching up for accepting digital payments, while maintaining social distancing norms, said a senior executive at a payment company, who confirmed the development.

“Moreover, the process of deployment is not efficient as well; a single merchant point is targeted by multiple payment companies creating needless complexities for customers and merchants,” the person said.

Leading UPI players such as Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe, BharatPe, Amazon Pay and Mobikwik have all been aggressive in deploying these stickers to onboard merchants, enabling contactless UPI payments.

In June, NPCI processed a record 1.34 billion transactions worth Rs 2.62 lakh crore.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76962669,imgsize-31209,width-800,height-434,overlay-ettech/rbi-sets-up-panel-to-study-qr-codes-for-contactless-transactions.jpg",ettechmobile,"The Reserve Bank of India has set up a high-level committee to study the use of Quick Response (QR) codes to process contactless transactions in light of the ongoing Covid-19 situation, three people aware of the matter told ET, and the panel is in the final stage of submitting its report.

"What was a turbulent enough week for TikTok turned downright bizarre on Friday.Already, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had warned that the Trump administration was looking at banning the short-video platform owned by Beijing-based parent ByteDance Ltd. over data-privacy concerns, and President Donald Trump himself said he was considering banning TikTok as one way to retaliate against China over the coronavirus. Then things got worse when Amazon .com Inc. on Friday sent an email to employees telling them to delete the TikTok app from mobile devices they use to access company email, citing “security risks.”The bizarre part happened just hours after that, when Amazon issued a statement saying the it had sent the email to its employees “in error” and there was no change in their policies toward TikTok. All clear? Not quite. For soon after Amazon corrected the record on its TikTok policy, Wells Fargo & Co. confirmed a report from the Information that the bank had told employees to delete the app from work phones because of “concerns about TikTok’s privacy and security controls and practices.”For sure, the company dodged a bullet when it comes to Amazon. But it is unknown whether the e-commerce giant intends to resend a similar email on TikTok policy in the future; clearly, someone drafted something. And the government threats remain. Not only that: The prospect of a potential ban has brought widespread anxiety to the TikTok community. In recent days, many creators posted tearful “goodbye” videos, with some asking their viewers to follow their accounts on other platforms such as YouTube and Instagram. What has been a slow boil of troublesome developments risks cascading into a full-blown public relations crisis. Whether or not the security concerns are justified or the motivations political, TikTok can and should do a lot more to address them and take more control of the narrative.TikTok’s responses, thus far, have been low-key. The company has said it keeps its user data in the U.S. with backups in Singapore and has never provided data to the Chinese government. On Friday, in response to the initial Amazon news, it said in a statement that “user security is of the utmost importance” to TikTok, adding it hadn’t heard from Amazon about its concerns and looks forward to a “dialogue so we can address any issues” the tech giant may have.A more proactive response is in order, and here are some things TikTok can do. First, statements aren’t enough. Where is TikTok’s CEO? Earlier this year, ByteDance hired former Walt Disney Co. executive Kevin Mayer to head up TikTok. You’d think the veteran media executive would be the perfect ambassador to help tamp down concerns. He needs to get out there and explain TikTok’s side of the story, whether in interviews to print press or on TV. He should know the basics of crisis management and PR strategy, following his long tenure in the upper ranks of a U.S. entertainment giant.Second, the Wall Street Journal on Thursday said ByteDance was considering making changes to its corporate structure, including the creation of a new management board for TikTok or designating a new headquarters for the company outside of China. While it won’t make a huge difference as TikTok will be still owned by the China-based ByteDance, both are easy, low-hanging-fruit-type moves that would at least give the appearance of more autonomy. They should go ahead and announce the changes as soon as possible. It also wouldn’t hurt to remind the public of TikTok’s growing U.S. workforce.And finally, TikTok needs to forcefully defend itself against the Trump administration’s conjecture and allegations. Yes, it’s a bit of a tricky situation as any pushback can backfire if not done tactfully, but the company can’t afford not to respond. Further, it should hire an external, independent consulting firm to do a full security audit. Anything to assuage the security and privacy concerns would help as the pressure isn’t going away. Late Friday, Fox Business’s Charlie Gasparino reported the White House is looking at using the Committee on Foreign Investment review as possible way to ban TikTok by saying its prior acquisition of Musical.ly was illegal. ByteDance has been under review by the interagency committee in the U.S. for its 2017 purchase of the lip-synching startup.In many ways, TikTok’s situation is similar to the public relations frenzy over Zoom Video Communications Inc. in early April. At the time, the video-conferencing company — whose service had seen an unprecedented surge from business customers and other entities looking to connect under lockdown — faced an avalanche of scrutiny over its security and privacy practices, including its use of Chinese servers. In response, CEO Eric Yuan proactively made himself available for numerous media interviews and helped restore his company’s reputation. He conducted weekly webinars, hired security experts and did whatever it took to educate the public that fears concerning his company’s products were overblown and that Zoom had taken concrete steps to address the issues. The strategy appears to have worked, as Zoom has managed to both retain customers and attract more to its platform.TikTok should take note and do the same.

Then things got worse when Amazon .com Inc. on Friday sent an email to employees telling them to delete the TikTok app from mobile devices they use to access company email, citing “security risks.”The bizarre part happened just hours after that, when Amazon issued a statement saying the it had sent the email to its employees “in error” and there was no change in their policies toward TikTok.","Amazon: TikTok gets an Amazon-sized scare, Technology News, ETtech",https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/mobile/76940681?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=ETRSS

"Shortage of new smartphones due to supply chain constraints has resulted in 30-40% fall week-on-week in sales in July despite robust demand as manufacturers tackle import impediments and production delays.Smartphone market trackers Counterpoint Research and International Data Corporation (IDC) said both offline and online channels are short of stocks for almost all brands and that the rollover impact of custom clearance delays which started in June will continue to impact sales throughout July. A leading agency has revised its April-June shipment estimates downward from 16 million units predicted earlier.“Crests and troughs in the demand-supply equation will be seen throughout July because, for parts to be shipped, assembled and distributed, it takes three-four weeks on average and above that we have regional lockdowns also,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint.Amid India-China tensions, the government initiated 100% manual checking of Chinese cargo at ports and airports between June 22-30, which led to a 10-day backlog in supplies of phones and parts.“Supply constraints continue to prevail with components stuck at the ports, especially for China-based vendors, and factories still running at less than half the capacity,” said Upasana Joshi, associate research manager at IDC, India. “The situation will take longer to improve than expected earlier, with supply bottlenecks clubbed with anti-Chinese sentiments.”Southern India’s largest multi-brand mobile phone retailer, Sangeetha Mobiles, which had seen 90% recovery in business in May-June as compared to pre-Covid numbers, said July sales fell to 40%.“Last two months the pent-up demand was high which is now tapering-off, and of course, supply has never been regular since Covid happened,” said Chandu Reddy, director, Sangeetha Mobiles. “We are told by most brands that fresh stocks will be provided in a week or so.”Vibhooti Prasad, managing director of 75 O-line-O stores in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane, said the company was able to service only 50 orders per day this week, down from 300 per day in June. “We are facing acute shortages of new devices in Mumbai.

"It’s going to be a busy week for Uber‘s legal department.

The ride-hailing app business is to appear in the UK‘s Supreme Court later today to defend its business model that classifies its drivers as independent contractors, not as employees, Reuters reports.

[Read: Germany developing legislation to be first to commercialize Level 4 autonomous vehicles]

The ride-hailing company’s hearing has been bumped up to the Supreme Court after two failed appeals over a case that started in 2016.

Back in 2016, two Uber drivers lobbied for gig-workers to receive basic employment benefits like minimum wage, paid holidays, and sanctioned rest breaks. The court ultimately ruled in their favor, however, Uber appealed the decision — twice.

Running out of options, the company has now pushed its appeal to the Supreme Court hoping for a different ruling.

A ruling is not expected until October and if Uber is unsuccessful it’s unlikely that it will be allowed to appeal again. Instead, a tribunal hearing will be needed to decide how the ruling should be applied.

According to CNBC’s Sam Shead, lawyers say that drivers could each be entitled to up to £12,000 (around $15,000) worth of compensation.

Lawyers fighting on behalf of the drivers, say tens of thousands of Uber drivers could be entitled to an average of £12,000 each in compensation — Sam Shead (@Sam_L_Shead) July 21, 2020

Criticisms against Uber‘s business model are nothing new, but in recent months those criticisms pose a more serious threat to the company.

Earlier this year, California‘s AB5 legislation came into force, which requires businesses like Uber to give its workers proper employment benefits. The company has continually fought against the requirement, and regulators last month threatened the company with closure if it doesn’t comply.

Yesterday, Dutch news outlet NOS reported that two Uber drivers from the UK were taking the company’s European headquarters to court over similar complaints that the company is in fact an employer and not just a neutral distributor of ride requests.

"One of India’s popular drone makers, Prathap NM, has been found to pass off drones made by German and Japanese companies as his own.

Last week, fact-checking site Alt News’ Pooja Chaudhari wrote a detailed post debunking Prathap’s claims about his self-made drones and awards.

Last year, Indiatimes published an article saying that Prathap, a 22-year-old independent tinkerer, has built over 600 drones from scratch, reclaiming parts from e-waste. The science grad reportedly started building drones since he was 16.

The report also claims that Prathap won the Albert Einstein Innovation Gold Medal at CEBIT expo held in Hannover Germany in 2018. However, there’s no such award at the CEBIT summit.

In a recent interview with Btv News Kannada, Prathap showed a photo featuring himself and a drone he claimed to have built.

. However, a statement from German drone maker BillzEye suggests that the owner of the company, Bill Gutbier, let him take a photo with the drone at the expo.

In another instance, Prathap put up a photo with a drone from the Japanese company ACSL on his Instagram. The company has denied any involvement with him on building drones.

[Read: Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine is starting to look like a winner]

At the beginning of this month, rumors on social media began to spread about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi roping in Prathap for a project with the country’s Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO). However, Prathap denied this development to Alt News and Boom Live. He also clarified this on Twitter through a video last week, which you can watch below.

The question still remains as to why Prathap hasn’t been able to provide some proof for the 600 drones he has claimed to build. We have contacted Prathap to comment on these reports, and we’ll update the story if we hear back.

Earlier today, Bengaluru’s quarantine squad managed to locate Prathap, who was missing from home since Saturday and was violating quarantine rules.

"When the British government abolished slavery in 1833, it handsomely compensated the 47,000 slave owners for the loss of their “property” – the enslaved men, women and children they had to give up ownership of. Some of this money went toward establishing new businesses, including Greene King, which is today one of the UK’s biggest breweries and pub chains. Along with other beneficiaries from the slave trade, Greene King recently apologized for its past and pledged to invest in Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.

This is part of what it means to decolonize your company. Decolonizing is an attempt to reverse the legacy of inequality and racism left by colonialism and redress the unequal power relations it produced and perpetuated. The process identifies these historical inequalities, then looks to disrupt their impact and develop ways of thinking that consider many diverse voices. Decolonizing is different from most equality, diversity, and inclusion work.

Decolonizing has been part of public discussions for many years. It gained notoriety in 2015 when students at the University of Cape Town demanded that a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes be taken down.

But it’s about more than toppling statues. For example, the Rhodes Must Fall movement focused on the wider issue of dismantling institutional racism that continues to plague much of the world’s educational, legal and business environments.

In this way, companies are facing demands to acknowledge their colonial histories and take concrete steps toward reparations. There is no legal basis for these actions, but it is important in moral, ethical and reputation terms to recognize an organization’s role in these historic legacies.

Fundamentally, decolonizing is not about absolving ourselves of imperial history. It is about recognizing and challenging the consequences of that history. Companies must understand the impact of colonialism on the global economy and the way businesses operate today. For example, where raw materials are exported from former colonies and value added goods are made in the homelands of the colonizers.

Decolonizing is not about jumping on the latest PR bandwagon or something companies should pay lip service to. Mindful of this, we propose the following steps that companies can use to start the process of decolonizing.

Research your history

An equality audit can be a starting point by using resources such as this UCL database, which reveals the identities of all the slave owners who were compensated when slavery was abolished. You can use it to explore the history of your company, its founders, partners and predecessors. As a result of this database, Greene King offered its recent apology and updated its company website to mention its historic links to the slave trade.

You can also identify the ways your company may have benefited historically from all aspects of colonialism and the communities that have suffered as a result of the company’s practices. Contrary to popular belief, the economic and developmental facts show that colonialism did not benefit the colonies.

If your company was established after the slave trade ended, consider how colonial dynamics may have influenced trade. Using the hashtag #SolidariTea, as some of Britain’s biggest tea brands have done to display support for Black Lives Matter on social media, might sound convincing. But these companies cannot meaningfully say they support Black Lives Matter before recognizing how their profits have been built on the exploitation of Black and brown labour.

Be ready to face painful truths.

Pledge to be anti-racist

A statement of acknowledgement and recognition should be informed by your equality audit. But it is not enough to avoid being racist – companies must be anti-racist.

This pledge should include concrete steps and actions the company is taking. These can be partnerships, business practices, financial commitments, diversity promotion and general cultural change.

Part of this pledge could include re-branding, as we have seen some businesses, universities and places named after slave traders do. While re-branding could be seen as a token step, for others this would be the first step to real change.

Be an ally

Leaders play an important role in decolonizing. By becoming an ally and standing with colleagues and customers against any form of exclusion, exploitation and disadvantage, companies can begin to challenge the systemic inequalities present in society.

Hiring, mentoring and promoting diverse colleagues will strengthen the diversity of thought and experience to help the business respond to the rapidly changing world.

Continually improve

The Overton window – the range of policies that are acceptable to mainstream society at any given time – is continuously shifting. In the same way that colonial practices were once seen as acceptable, actions (or inaction) that are deemed acceptable today will not necessarily be so in the future. Decolonizing must be a continuous process where companies revisit their actions and take steps to identify other potential forms of inequality that their business practices create.

Business tends to be a zero sum game, where one company’s gain is a competitor’s loss. When performance is linked to profit it is easy to give priority only to value generation rather than the morality of business actions. Instead, companies should think about ethical productivity and focus on new systems of value that are not purely financial.

Finally, taking actions as a PR exercise, or doing so because the business case is the main consideration, is simply decolonization lite. Real decolonizing is a long-term process with concrete actions that incur a short-term cost to the business, for the ultimate gain of doing the right thing.

"Welcome to TNW Basics, a collection of tips, guides, and advice on how to easily get the most out of your gadgets, apps, and other stuff.

Discord is home to many, many servers that have nothing to do with gaming. So if you’re not a gamer and are looking for a place where you can meet new friends and find people to talk to (something we could all use right now), here’s how to go about doing it.

Discord makes no secret of the fact that it started out as a gamer’s voice chat app. Gaming iconography and memes have been baked into Discord since it launched. However, Discord‘s recently made a push to grow beyond its gamer-friendly beginnings. I suspect the primary impetus for this is that, as COVID is forcing us all to social distance and communicate via whatever video chatting platforms we can get hold of, Discord wants to scoop some of that non-gaming Zoom crowd.

If you’re not a gamer, don’t be put off by Discord if you’ve heard of it first as a gamer’s platform. It’s still a great platform even for small groups, with voice chat that supports multiple people and multiple text chat rooms open in a single server — you can even set up your own server just for your friends or family. It’s also got thousands of servers — you’re bound to find your people on one of them.

To start, you can find servers but scrolling all the way down to the bottom of the list of servers and finding the icon that looks like a compass (this used to look like a magnifying glass). This will allow you to explore servers that are open to the public.

Discord‘s helpfully split the servers into different categories, including gaming, movies & tv, education, and music among others. You can also search for specific kinds of servers with the search bar. I will admit one thing — a lot of Discord’s largest servers are gaming-related in some way, so don’t be put off if the most popular results to your search seem to center around gaming. Just keep going deeper and you’ll find some slightly less-populated but no less active servers hidden away.

And that’s it! Hopefully you can now find a Discord server that’s right for you. Good luck!

"Dear people of the future: we’re sorry for whatever horrible thing we did that caused the apocalypse (was it nukes? climate change? killer robots? idiots who wouldn’t wear masks during a pandemic?). But the good news is, if you’re reading this you must have found GitHub’s buried data archive containing everything you need to reboot society — pun intended.

GitHub inc, a Microsoft subsidiary, recently archived some 21 terabytes of data in long-term storage in hopes that an advanced future society will one day use it for historical purposes. Maybe they’ll want to know what kind of clumsy computers 21st century humans used. Maybe they’ll just want to play Doom. Either way, the archive contains as much information about human computing as GitHub could squeeze into it, including all the open-source AI code a future retroist could ever want to toy with.

According to Github:

The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain. The archive is located in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago, closer to the North Pole than the Arctic Circle. GitHub will capture a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020 and preserve that data in the Arctic Code Vault.

Assuming nothing goes wrong, future generations should be able to figure out a way to run our old data archives on their fancy brain computers (or whatever they use in the 3000s). But GitHub isn’t taking any chances. If things go bad for humans — and let’s face it we’re not exactly trending well right now – the archive contains a human-readable “tech tree” including a Rosetta stone and everything our poor post-apocalyptic progeny will need to rebuild society in our image.

Per Github:

The Tech Tree will serve as a quickstart manual on software development and computing, bundled with a user guide for the archive. It will describe how to work backwards from raw data to source code and extract projects, directories, files, and data formats. Inspired by (and including elements of) the Long Now’s Manual for Civilization, the archive will also include information and guidance for applying open source, with context for how we use it today, in case future readers need to rebuild technologies from scratch.

The render comes from tipster Evan Blass, who shows it from every angle in a spin. From what we can tell, it’ll have a flat screen, a thin set of bezels, and a smaller camera than the Note 20 Ultra. The render also matches up with previously leaked still images of the device from leaker Ice Universe:

The Note 20, along with the Ultra, will make its official debut at Samsung‘s event on August 5. Supposedly the company will reveal five new devices at the event. While we don’t know for sure what the non-Note 20 devices will be, the frontrunners include the Galaxy Watch 3 and the Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds. We’ll also likely see the Galaxy Fold 2, which was teased by a tweet from Samsung over the weekend.

"Oxford researchers have developed a potential vaccine for COVID-19. Early testing in more than 1,000 clinical trial participants indicates the treatment is both safe and effective.

Epidemiology breakthroughs aren’t our usual subject matter here at TNW, but the opportunity to finally publish some actual good news about the COVID-19 pandemic was just too much for us to pass up.

The team, which included researchers from Oxford, and the Philipps University of Marburg, Germany, developed the vaccine, called chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), by genetically-engineering a different virus known to cause the common cold in chimpanzees.

While ChAdOx1nCoV-19 isn’t the first or only COVID-19 vaccine in clinical trials (there’s actually about 140 in various stages of research right now), it might be the most promising. It not only triggers positive antibodies to fight coronavirus, but also antiviral t-cells.

A study published today in The Lancet indicates the vaccine has made it through both level one and two clinical trials without a proclivity for severe side-effects. Although a whopping 70% of healthy test subjects did report fever, headache, or both. The researchers are confident these side-effects can be mitigated in a finished vaccine.

According to the study, nearly every participant who participated in the drug trial – about nine in ten – showed antibody and t-cell response. A small control group of participants who were given a second dose all showed positive immune-system response to COVID-19.

Stage three clinical trials have already begun with more than 10,000 participants. This phase of testing requires raising dosages in patients until either the anticipated immune response or harmful side-effects reach a predetermined threshold.

Quick take: This is good news, but take it with a grain of salt. Other trials are actually further along. Even if everything works out perfectly, there’s very little chance we’ll see this vaccine reach the general public in the UK before the end of 2021.

But that doesn’t mean we can’t be optimistic. The UK has already ordered over 100 million doses of ChAdOx1nCoV-19 because this trial is the most promising one yet.

As one trial participant recently noted in an interview with Salome Phelamei of the Times Now News:

The speed of this trial was the discussion between me and my wife because we both are pharma professionals. Then there is also the consideration that time is not in our favour whatsoever. There are lives of masses at stake and there is the plummeting economy. It still surprises me but I am confident because the encouraging part of is if the phase 2 was successful with 1000 volunteers then only they’ll go for the 10,000 which started on the last week of June. So, this gives me hope, yes, the trial is going on fine.

Once the vaccine finishes stage three trials it can be approved by government bodies for use. Then it’ll hit stage four trials where we’ll see how it stacks up against similar treatments.

"Despite coming down hard on Tesla’s self-driving tech last week, Germany is looking to lead Europe in self-driving cars and is reportedly working on a broad framework to regulate Level 4 autonomous vehicles to do so.

According to a report by Automotive News Europe (ANE), the framework is currently being reviewed by the transportation ministry and other government departments. All being well, the legislation could be ready for next summer.

“The planned new legal framework should create the prerequisites in the current legislative period to allow for the standard operation of autonomous, driverless motorized vehicles on public roads, limited geographically to a defined environment,” the German transportation ministry told ANE.

Level 4 autonomous vehicles are those that can take full control of a vehicle under specific conditions, such as in a geo-fenced area, weather, traffic, and road types.

While companies like Waymo and Uber are testing systems like this in the US, at the moment, there are no globally accepted standards for regulating the technology in a commercial setting.

The fact that Europe also lacks any formal rules on the tech means Germany can forge ahead and make its own.

Credit: Wikimedia Commons Google’s Waymo cars can self-drive in certain places, under certain conditions. They still need a driver for safety and to drive between test areas. Germany says its roads would be open to ‘any operator.’

“As long as there are no EU-wide rules in place that would constitute what is called a harmonized area of European law, member states themselves can push ahead — beyond just testing prototypes or approving pilot programs,” said Benedikt Wolfers who is a partner at law firm Posser Spieth Wolfers & Partners and an expert in automotive legislation.

“Germany wants to be the first country to draft a such a law,” he added.

We’ll have to wait a while longer before we can see the legislation first hand. However, according to Wolfers: “It goes beyond experimenting with prototypes, it is expressly directed to the commercialization of autonomous transport for people and goods.”

Though just because the legal framework will be in place, don’t expect operators to flood the market. The technology still has a long way to go before it can be considered for use.

If Germany does pass the legislation it could lay out a clear framework in time for when technology actually catches up.

Last week, a German court ruled that Tesla‘s use of the words “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” to market its vehicles is misleading and can lead to potentially dangerous misuse of the driver aid systems.

"Welcome to TNW Basics, a collection of tips, guides, and advice on how to easily get the most out of your gadgets, apps, and other stuff.

If you’re working with spreadsheets on a regular basis, you know that it’s important to keep your tables of data easy to explore and digest. You can do this by cleaning your data, and by styling and structuring your data appropriately.

For instance, you could freeze your top header row, in order to keep it in place when you’re scroll down your table of data. You do this by selecting the row, hitting the View menu item, and then Freeze, and picking 1 row.

Another way to use styling to keep your table compact and enjoyable for the eye, is to make sure the headers aren’t too long. This is to prevent the columns from needing to become too wide or different in width, or the header cells to become multiline. Of course, you could simply use abbreviations or other terms for your headers. But there’s a neat little function baked into Google Sheets, that might do the trick even better, and will even give your table a sassy look.

Now before revealing this to you, let’s look at a table of data that hasn’t been treated by this neat little function yet.

As you can see, the header in the F column is being cut off, because its text is too wide. To make sure the columns keep the same width, but the text to be fully readable, we can use the text rotation function. Simply select the first row, and then click the menu icon that shows an angled ‘A’ and an upward point arrow below it. Next, you’ll have the choice of multiple rotation options. Let’s select the second option called ‘Tilt up’. The result should be as follows.

Much better already. To make it look even prettier, you could start playing with coloring, for instance giving the header row one color, and the data rows alternating colors. So, what are you waiting for? Back to work, and show off your sheet wizardry!

"Today, artificial intelligence programs can recognize faces and objects in photos and videos, transcribe audio in real-time, detect cancer in x-ray scans years in advance, and compete with humans in some of the most complicated games.

Until a few years ago, all these challenges were either thought insurmountable, decades away, or were being solved with sub-optimal results. But advances in neural networks and deep learning, a branch of AI that has become very popular in the past few years, has helped computers solve these and many other complicated problems.

Unfortunately, when created from scratch, deep learning models require access to vast amounts of data and compute resources. This is a luxury that many can’t afford. Moreover, it takes a long time to train deep learning models to perform tasks, which is not suitable for use cases that have a short time budget.

Fortunately, transfer learning, the discipline of using the knowledge gained from one trained AI model to another, can help solve these problems.

The cost of training deep learning models

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, the science of developing AI through training examples. The concepts and science behind deep learning and neural networks is as old as the term “artificial intelligence” itself. But until recent years, they had been largely dismissed by the AI community for being inefficient.

The availability of vast amounts of data and compute resources in the past few years have pushed neural networks into the limelight and made it possible to develop deep learning algorithms that can solve real world problems.

To train a deep learning model, you basically must feed a neural network with lots of annotated examples. These examples can be things such as labeled images of objects or mammograms scans of patients with their eventual outcomes. The neural network will carefully analyze and compare the images and develop mathematical models that represent the recurring patterns between images of a similar category.

[Read: Weird AI illustrates why algorithms still need people]

There already exists several large open-source datasets such as ImageNet, a database of more than 14 million images labeled in 22,000 categories, and MNIST, a dataset of 60,000 handwritten digits. AI engineers can use these sources to train their deep learning models.

However, training deep learning models also requires access to very strong computing resources. Developers usually use clusters of CPUs, GPUs or specialized hardware such as Google’s Tensor Processors (TPUs) to train neural networks in a time-efficient way. The costs of purchasing or renting such resources can be beyond the budget of individual developers or small organizations. Also, for many problems, there aren’t enough examples to train robust AI models.

Transfer learning makes deep learning training much less demanding

Say an AI engineer wants to create an image classifier neural network to solve a specific problem. Instead of gathering thousands and millions of images, the engineer can use one of the publicly available datasets such as ImageNet and enhance it with domain-specific photos.

But the AI engineer must still rent pay a hefty sum to rent the compute resources necessary to run those millions of images through the neural network. This is where transfer learning comes into play. Transfer learning is the process of creating new AI models by fine-tuning previously trained neural networks.

Instead of training their neural network from scratch, developers can download a pretrained, open-source deep learning model and finetune it for their own purpose. There are many pretrained base models to choose from. Popular examples include AlexNet, Google’s Inception-v3, and Microsoft’s ResNet-50. These neural networks have already been trained on the ImageNet dataset. AI engineers only need to enhance them by further training them with their own domain-specific examples.

Transfer learning doesn’t require huge compute resources. In most cases, a decent desktop computer or a strong laptop can finetune a pretrained neural network in a few hours or even less.

How does transfer learning work?

Interestingly, neural networks develop their behavior in a hierarchical way. Every neural network is composed of multiple layers. After training, each of the layers become tuned to detect specific features in the input data.

For instance, in an image classifier convolutional network, the first few layers detect general features such as edges, corners, circles, and blobs of colors. As you go deeper into the network, the layers start to detect more concrete things such as eyes, faces, and full objects.

Top layers of neural networks detect general features. Deeper layers detect actual objects (source: arxiv.org)

When doing transfer learning, AI engineers freeze the first layers of the pre-trained neural network. These are the layers that detect general features that are common across all domains. Then they finetune the deeper layers to finetune them with their own examples and add new layers to classify new categories included in their training dataset.

The pre-trained and finetuned AI models are also respectively called the “teacher” and “student” models.

The number of frozen and finetuned layers depend on the similarities between the source and destination AI models. If the student AI model solves a problem that is very close of the teacher, there’s no need to finetune the layers of the pretrained model. The developer only needs to append a new layer at the end of the network and train the AI for the new categories. This is called “deep-layer feature extraction.” Deep feature extraction is also preferable when there’s very little training data for the destination domain.

When there are considerable differences between the source and destination, or training examples are abundant, the developers unfreeze several layers in the pretrained AI model. Then they add the new classification layer and finetune the unfrozen layers with the new examples. This is called “mid-layer feature extraction.”

In cases where there are significant differences between the source and destination AI models, the developers unfreeze and retrain the entire neural network. Called “full model fine-tuning,” this type of transfer learning also requires a lot of training examples.

It might seem absurd to take a pretrained model and retrain all its layers. But in practice, it saves time and compute resources. Before training, the variables in a neural network are initialized with random numbers and adapt their values as they process the training data. The values of the variables of a pretrained neural network have already been tuned to the millions of training examples. Therefore they are a much better starting point for a new AI model that wants to train on a new set of examples that have even the slightest similarities with the source AI model.

Transfer learning is not a silver bullet

Transfer learning wolves many of the problems of training AI models in an efficient and affordable way. However, it also has tradeoffs. If a pretrained neural network has security holes, the AI models that use it as the basis for transfer learning with inherit those vulnerabilities.

For instance, a base model might not be robust against adversarial attacks, carefully crafted input examples that force the AI to change its behavior in erratic ways. If a malicious actor manages to develop an adversarial example for a base model, their attack will work on most of the AI models that have been derived from it. Researchers at the University of Chicago, UC Santa Clara and Virgina Tech showed this in a paper presented at the Usenix Security Symposium last year.

Also, in some domains, such as teaching AI to play games, the use of transfer learning is very limited. Those AI models are trained on reinforcement learning, a branch of AI that is very compute-intensive and requires a lot of trial and error. In reinforcement learning, most new problems are unique and require their own AI model and training process.

But all in all, for most deep learning applications, such as image classification and natural language processing, there’s a likely chance that you’ll be able to shortcut your way with a good dose of clever transfer learning.

"With a constantly evolving datacentre environment, IT professionals may be used to dealing with a variety of issues ranging from maintaining security from hackers to dealing with a diverse array of complex workloads They, however, have never dealt with a pandemic like Covid 19. Nearly all industries will be impacted by the ongoing spread of the virus and we need to be aware of the potential IT and related business issues that could arise.The ground reality is that there will be disruptions to IT operations in the data centres during this pandemic. Given that there are widespread and strict travel restrictions , last-mile IT field engineers could be face challenges such as being denied access to critical facilties that they typically monitor.Moreover, even if they can get to a customer location , physical access to customer premises to resolve hardware faults in the data centre - like switching out a simple drive – may be hampered due to quarantine restrictions.Looking at the broader situation also reveals other potential barriers to minimising potential disruptions. One common aspect when resolving faults in IT infrastructures and systems could be access to complex as well as commonplace parts like fans and power equipment.These parts could be requisitioned for higher-order public health concerns or they could be delayed by the challenges of shipping it from geographic regions where there is restricted movement. Both the manufacturing and distribution of such parts are likely to be delayed, which would also cause delays in implementing any solutions.Maintaining uptime with regards to IT assets and regular operations requires various steps in the current environment. Enterprises with IT asset management control will be more equipped to to maintain stable IT operations given their ability to have a complete IT inventory that facilitates asset tracking, thereby enabling more control over the company’s IT environment.Apart from knowing where all of their hardware assets are located in the world, and given the various on-ground scenarios and restrictions around the world, they also have the ability to detect faults that may occur during this global challenge.The increased use of automation, robotics and AI by organisations adopting these advanced technologies is also having a significant impact on their business and IT operations.Dynamic baselining is one such instance where organizations are reaping dividends from predictive analytics to proactively manage infrastructure. Another example is the integration of technologies like S.M.A.R.T. events which can generate alerts prior to actual failure.Organisations are applying remote automation and AI to ensure uninterrupted operations, through automated and proactive fault detection and resolution capabilities.The strength of AI tools in terms of pattern recognition by predicting and self-learning is also leading to rapid troubleshooting of IT issues, potentially leading to quicker turnaround times than through human interaction. Such technologies are really coming into their own and becoming rapidly relevant and faster given the restrictions posed by social distancing.The versatility of remote monitoring tools to automate fault resolution processes for hardware infrastructures is also becoming significant. These tools can initiate service tickets for hardware component failures, communicating with systems remotely through standard protocols like SNMP, WMI and SSH and then convey hardware events back to the IT administrator through a secure outbound TCP connection.Severe disruptions could also overwhelm call centres and their staff. In such a situation, effective IT customer service portals could help enterprise customers to raise and monitor service tickets from any device, leading to rapid monitoring and resolution of their faults.Beyond customer service portals, the ubiquity of mobile applications and their capabilities is also leading to increased recognition of their strengths. Mobile apps enable users to identify devices that need support by simply using the phone’s camera to scan the bar code.The application then triggers the automatic insertion of the corresponding serial number in a ticket submission form. Companies using mobile apps through traditional portals can elevate the convenience and efficiency of service and attention, all while finding a new way to stay connected.The severity of the current crisis, while being a major cause for concern, is also leading to a rethink on how organizations can evolve and innovate to minimise disruptions. There are various services and tools that can alleviate the pressure on IT operations and bring peace of mind to businesses.More importantly, automation and remote monitoring can have a huge impact in reducing outages while using their flexibility to help organizations navigate through these turbulent times.The author is Director of Product Management at Park Place Technologies DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

"An incentive policy for the private sector companies to set up data center parks in India will make it affordable for firms to store data locally vis-à-vis other locations such as Singapore and also prepare them for the deluge of data which is expected to be generated in the country in the next few years with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G.“There is a tsunami of data which is expected to hit India and the country is expected to be a huge market for data centers since companies will prefer it to be stored here for lesser latency. This policy is preparing the country for that deluge in the long run,” said a senior government official.The person said that irrespective of whether the government mandates data localisation or not, large companies like Facebook or Google have already been contemplating moving their data centers to India since it’s a business requirement for them given the size of India’s data market. With close to 450 million Internet users, India is already the largest market for companies like Facebook in terms of users.""If the government makes it affordable then companies will automatically to store data in India instead of looking at countries like Singapore or the US,"" said Sangeeta Gupta, chief strategy officer of Nasscom. Last year, when it was speculated that the government may ask companies to store all their data in India, industry criticised it arguing that the cost of keeping data in India was huge and will impact businesses, especially SMEs negatively.On Friday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that a policy will be worked out for the private sector to set up data centers in India to take advantage of how “analytics, fintech and Internet of Things (IOT) are changing the way we deal with our lives.”However, industry will require not just sops if the government has to attract private companies to set up data centres in the country and will also need support in terms of real-estate, 24*7 internet connectivity, uninterrupted power etc along with a promise of security from the government if they have to look at as a destination for data centres.“The demand has been huge for data centers in India. There is so much data consumption in India, and if it’s closer home, it will be cheaper and the latency will also be lower,” said Akhilesh Tuteja, Global Cyber Security practice Co-leader at KPMG. He added that however data centers are extremely heavy on capital expenditure and the government will have to provide resilience of infrastructure such as power, cooling, connectivity, reliable real-estate etc.”Several large firms such as Adani Group, Hiranandani Group and Reliance Industries have already announced investment plans to set up data centres in various parts of the country.Several large firms such as Adani Group, Hiranandani Group and Reliance Industries have already announced investment plans to set up data centres in various parts of the country.Analysts said dedicated zone for such a park has already been announced and work has started to build such facilities as the government is pushing to create infrastructure.“Essentially, with the push for digitisation across all sectors you need adequate infrastructure at the back-end with data warehouses.

"By Stephen Worn Often smaller data centers that provide cloud computing support and processing by expanding the Edge of the network can be categorized as Edge data centers. As they are geographically closer to the end user, services are delivered at a faster pace. At times, a single Edge data center may be connected to many other Edge data centers that can be used to store, process and cache data and deliver the required information when needed – at the right time at the right place.So, with Edge computing in place, the need for a centralized data center can be disrupted with an Edge data center, as cloud features are available at the place of operations. While Edge data centers will be providing an array of services independently, a more centralized data center can be backing them up with cloud services and analytics.India is increasingly seeing a big opportunity in the business of data centers with three major companies including the Adani Group announcing plans to enter the segment. Also, India is on the path to become one of the biggest global destinations of colocation data center setups where cloud computing architecture facilities can be used by many different companies. Slowly, many see cloud computing is inching towards Edge computing. The next few years will continue to see a huge acceptance of Edge data centers as data is analysed and processed near the location where it is generated instead of being processed in a more distant and centralized data center.The New India mantra is digital transformation. Hence, one of the most important initiatives rolled out by the government is the Smart Cities Mission which will be rolling out 100 Smart Cities in four phases. These Smart Cities have given rise to the need for more data centers. Owing to some of these being present in Tier-2 and Tier-3 locations, Edge data centers will play a crucial role. Many Indian companies in the last three months have shown interest in the same and have explored the options of investing in data centers in India. As example, real estate major Hiranandani Goup has announced plans to invest Rs 14,000 crore (almost USD$2 billion) in its data center projects.Use of IoT devices globally is increasing and storing such massive data amounts on a distant cloud environment is seen by many as literally unimaginable. Additionally, the costs and latency of transferring the data to a distant server and processing it in that location is not an advantageous proposition. IoT often depends on cloud network access to understand about both machine learning and complex programs, and here is where Edge computing is beneficial. Businesses in India and globally are increasingly exploring Edge data centers to minimize the operational costs as an IoT app is best suited to leverage Edge data centers.The author is CTO and Managing Director, NAM, Datacenter Dynamics DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

"NEW DELHI: The business of setting up large data centres , trudging along nicely over the years, has picked up pace lately, with at least three major business groups announcing plans to enter this segment in the last four months alone, and established players going ahead with aggressive expansion plans of their own.In July, the Adani group said it would invest up to Rs 70,000 crore to set up solar powered data parks in Andhra Pradesh.This was followed by real estate major Hiranandani Group announcing a Rs 14,000 crore investment plan, and Reliance Industries partnering with Microsoft to provide cloud services to small and medium enterprises.Last week, incumbent Oracle announced the launch of its Gen 2 Cloud region in Mumbai, with another planned in Hyderabad.ST Telemedia Global Data Centres (STT GDC), which currently has a capacity of 70 MW spread over 2.14 million square feet, plans to double this by March 2020, and grow further to 200 MW over 4 million sq ft, within three years.A move towards a connected, inclusive digital economy means more and more data is being generated across platforms such as Cloud and social media as well as accessed by more people using mobile technology.All this data needs to be stored, managed and disseminated to users via public and private cloud, making data centres a key pillar in digital transformation.“In terms of growth in data, India is outpacing even the developed world. More data means more data centres, which are growing at almost 25% CAGR. To meet this growing need, existing and new providers are building new capacities across India,” said Sumit Mukhija, CEO, STT GDC India, a joint venture between Singapore’s STT and Tata Communications.According to various industry estimates, the data centre outsourcing market in India, currently pegged at close to $2 billion, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 25% to reach $5 billion by financial year 2023-24.Data centres are measured in two ways — on the power that they consume and the data that they store or process.Most companies use the first metric, as that is more defined.In India, colocation setups are being deployed with cloud computing architecture, putting the country on a path to becoming one of the biggest hubs for colocation data centres globally. Colocation data centres are shared facilities where the infrastructure is used by different companies.With cloud adoption rising, a robust and scalable infrastructure is critical.“What drives us forward is the fact that cloud computing is now moving towards edge computing.In the course of the next few years, we anticipate the edge to become the most mission-critical part of an organisation’s digital ecosystem,” said Sunil Khanna, Managing Director, Vertiv India, a provider of data centre equipment and services that projects demand will be driven by the IT, BFSI and telecom industries.In edge computing, the data is processed closer to where it is being generated, rather than a central cloud or data centre.Alongside the growth in mobile data consumption, the government’s digitisation drive and thrust on Smart Cities is also fuelling demand for more data centres. Besides, data is moving from being stored on-premise to the cloud, with many enterprises adopting the ‘as a service’ model of infrastructure consumption.Initially, the large investments in the space came from established hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services and Google.“The cloud market is growing at 40% and a lot of investment is going towards supporting this and building next-gen infrastructure.Partnerships like the one between Reliance and Microsoft or a real estate firm entering this business are quite unique to India,” said Naveen Mishra, senior director analyst at Gartner.Reliance has said it would offer Microsoft cloud services to small and medium enterprises through Jio, and also set up data centres that would run Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform.India’s push for data localisation, which require certain kinds of data to be stored within the country, has generated significant demand already as it is estimated that over 75% of this data now resides outside the country.Last year, the Reserve Bank of India mandated that all data of financial transactions should be located on servers in India. It also clarified that the data which is taken outside of India for processing should be brought back. This forced global companies such as Mastercard and Visa to begin the process of storing data in India.Banking and financial services institutions have been the earliest adopters of local data centres.The industry had been growing at close to 30% in the last ten years, boosted by the introduction of 3G and 4G, followed by the rollout of Jio mobile services, said Sunil Gupta, who is often called the data centre man of India and who the Hiranandani group roped in to spearhead their foray into this space due to his vast experience in the field.“Given the number of customers, India needs 15 times more capacity.India needs largescale data centres in the same way that it needs roadways,” said Gupta, the CEO of Yotta Infrastructure, a company that plans to set up large selfsufficient data parks which would give customers the option to increase capacity in the same location.This is similar to what the Adani Group plans to do by building data parks instead of standalone buildings that host data centres.Even as large operators double down on their expansion plans, many small, single-city data centre operators are also now going national.“We will go from 30,000 square feet to 2 lakh square feet by 2020-22,” said Nikhil Rathi, CEO of Web Werks, which has over the last ten years operated a single data centre in Mumbai.Web Werks, in addition to expanding its presence in Mumbai, will reach in to the major metros and a few other cities by then.Similarly, ESDS Software Services, which started out with operations in Nashik, its home market, is now expanding in India and outside.“We were among the first firms to be empaneled with the government and are seeing a lot of business coming from Smart Cities; and public distribution schemes of many states connect to our cloud,” said Piyush Somani, CMD, ESDS Software Services.These local data centre players are now actively looking beyond Tier I cities and setting up operations in Tier II towns.“There is definitely a lot of interest in this space and we’ve seen an increase in international queries in the last few months,” said Rishu Sharma, Cloud Principal Analyst, Cloud and Artificial Intelligence, IDC India.However, given the challenges of operating in India, most international operators are keen to enter either through a partnership or by acquiring a local player.Netmagic, which is among the oldest players in this space, was acquired by Japanese tech firm NTT a few years ago and remains among the biggest in this space, with further capacity expansions planned in Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru.Some smaller international firms have, however, successfully set up local operations though.The US-headquartered Linode, which offers data centre solutions mainly to the software developer community, set up base in the country recently.“We already had a lot of customers in India, but now instead of Singapore, their data will be hosted in India,” said Blair Lyon, VPMarketing, Linode.The boom in demand for data centres has also resulted in growth for other allied businesses.Networking firm Juniper Networks, for instance, has seen the transition from 90% of early internet traffic being hosted outside India to almost 70% of the OTT content being hosted domestically.Juniper is working on making the data centre infrastructure invisible for applications to ride demand at will, rather than being constrained by defined network.The need for high quality experience is driving all the top global Cloud players into having an India footprint, said Pankaj Kitchlu -Systems Engineering Director (India-Saarc), Juniper Networks.“We keep continually working with all Enterprise, Cloud and Service Providers to build platforms that securely connect the consumption point to the nearest content delivery point,” Kitchlu said.Yet, despite the opportunities, the challenges are still significant.Access to uninterrupted power supply and land banks in areas where there is demand are two key worries.“India’s power infrastructure woes limit the expansion to tier 1 cities, where real estate is expensive and scarce, thereby driving up capex costs. Furthermore, building and operating quality data centres demands highly-skilled professionals in specialized areas such as cooling, power, security, network,” said STT’s Mukhija.These skills aren’t always readily available, compelling operators to invest significantly in training people themselves.The lack of a clear set of rules is another bottleneck. That is, however, expected to change with the National Digital Communication Policy 2018 which promises regulatory reforms.The policy document calls for evolving an enabling regulatory framework and incentives to promote the establishment of international data centres, content delivery networks and independent interconnect exchanges in India.Be that as it may, as 5G rollouts and use cases for industrial IoT start gaining steam, demand will increase, said Gupta, the ‘data centre man of India’. “It will only go up, and not slow down.”",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-71716367,imgsize-135164,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/data-centres-may-prove-to-be-the-next-big-opportunity-in-india.jpg",cio_etc_dc,"NEW DELHI: The business of setting up large data centres , trudging along nicely over the years, has picked up pace lately, with at least three major business groups announcing plans to enter this segment in the last four months alone, and established players going ahead with aggressive expansion plans of their own.In July, the Adani group said it would invest up to Rs 70,000 crore to set up solar powered data parks in Andhra Pradesh.This was followed by real estate major Hiranandani Group announcing a Rs 14,000 crore investment plan, and Reliance Industries partnering with Microsoft to provide cloud services to small and medium enterprises.Last week, incumbent Oracle announced the launch of its Gen 2 Cloud region in Mumbai, with another planned in Hyderabad.ST Telemedia Global Data Centres (STT GDC), which currently has a capacity of 70 MW spread over 2.14 million square feet, plans to double this by March 2020, and grow further to 200 MW over 4 million sq ft, within three years.A move towards a connected, inclusive digital economy means more and more data is being generated across platforms such as Cloud and social media as well as accessed by more people using mobile technology.All this data needs to be stored, managed and disseminated to users via public and private cloud, making data centres a key pillar in digital transformation.“In terms of growth in data, India is outpacing even the developed world.

"A string of successful bets on ports, mining and commodities helped transform Gautam Adani from a nondescript diamond trader into a tycoon with a net worth of $10 billion.Now the Indian businessman is setting his sight on what he believes could become another big money maker: Selling data storage services to companies such as Amazon .com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google India’s government is weighing a new law that would require data to be stored locally, and his conglomerate Adani Enterprises Ltd. has said it expects to invest Rs 700 billion ($10.2 billion) to build data parks in a southern state over the next two decades. The billionaire’s hope is to capitalize on demand from foreign technology companies, who are expanding in India as the use of smartphones and Internet surges.If the proposed law goes through “it will explode data storage requirements, and that will need capacity,” Adani said in a rare interview in New Delhi. “This will be a multi-billion-dollar project that will bring in the Googles and the Amazons of the world.”It’s an approach that’s been a hallmark of Adani’s empire: Pick a hot new industry -- especially one favored by the government -- build the infrastructure, and keep going till you hit the top. Much like China, India has sought to draw more private investment to ramp up its infrastructure as it attempts to double GDP to $5 trillion over coming years.When the Indian government pushed for gas projects in cities for cooking and transportation, Adani’s group bid for and won many licenses, a move that could make it the biggest player in gas retailing. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to develop local manufacturing of defense equipment, Adani quickly built the capacity to supply the military by going on an aggressive shopping spree of defense contractors.And when Adani’s group decided to get involved in operations of airports, it bid almost double its main competitors in some cases. A clean sweep in the bidding process is set to add six airfields to the business overnight.“Our main goal is nation building through infrastructure,” the billionaire said. “The Adani Group has always focused on businesses in line [with] the government’s vision.”Adani, 57, built his empire around heavily regulated businesses of coal mining, electricity and ports, a reflection of his ability to navigate different political parties and governments in states and at the center in New Delhi.The focus of his empire is the 15,000 hectare industrial zone at Mundra in the western state of Gujarat, which houses the group’s largest port and the country’s largest power plant. Adani began commercial operations of its largest port in Mundra in 2001 and built the industrial cluster around it in the following years, when Modi was the executive head of the state of Gujarat. Since then, Adani has rapidly expanded his various businesses, many of which complement each other.As in other infrastructure businesses, by expanding into data centers, the businessman would be entering a space that demands large investment. He would also have to contend with competition from any other large Indian players who decide to make a big push into the industry.One of the big supporters of data localization has been Adani’s fellow billionaire Mukesh Ambani , Asia’s richest man. Ambani has argued that India’s data must be controlled and owned by Indians, and not by global corporations. Ambani’s younger brother, Anil, has also built data centers in India.A draft of India’s 2018 Personal Data Protection Bill mandates storage of personal data on a server or in a data center located in the country, citing the need to protect the autonomy of individuals and their personal data. The bill, considered by the government, would need to be approved by lawmakers.“The concerns over data security is fueling the need for countries to demand localization of data and India being a growing economy, I don’t expect global data giants like Google, Amazon or Alibaba to overlook this market,” said Apalak Ghosh, industry manager for digital transformation at Frost & Sullivan.While that would offer a big business opportunity for service providers, the need for real estate would mean that investments could run into “billions of dollars,” Ghosh said.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-70172160,imgsize-577884,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/gautam-adani-woos-amazon-and-google-with-indian-data-hubs.jpg",cio_etc_dc,"A string of successful bets on ports, mining and commodities helped transform Gautam Adani from a nondescript diamond trader into a tycoon with a net worth of $10 billion.Now the Indian businessman is setting his sight on what he believes could become another big money maker: Selling data storage services to companies such as Amazon .com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google India’s government is weighing a new law that would require data to be stored locally, and his conglomerate Adani Enterprises Ltd. has said it expects to invest Rs 700 billion ($10.2 billion) to build data parks in a southern state over the next two decades.

"The government is planning to set up a national data governance centre to hold all public data , and establish guidelines for the management, sharing and monetisation of information. State agencies and even startups could access the data through this facility.“This division will be more about guidelines, standards, interactions and so on. This could be housed in the Ministry of IT and Electronics (MeitY) and all community data — not personal data, but public data, including anonymous data — would fall under the purview of this centre,” a government official told ET.Public data relates to freely available information that is collated by various agencies or companies in the course of their operations and which can be traded without restrictions or be used for public utility purposes. This includes traffic and illness patterns.“Data has an economic value, but who, when and where uses that, that would then lie under a national data-sharing policy to be developed under the data governance centre,” the official said, adding that all personal data-related issues, however, would fall under the purview of the proposed personal data-protection law. The Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill is expected to be introduced in Parliament soon.Another official said the new body will also address the current confusion around which wing of the government actually handles matters related to data or which is the nodal point for matters related to data. Already, three agencies — MeitY, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and commerce ministry — jump in to control aspects of data, especially those related to privacy and security.Besides MeitY’s PDP Bill 2018, Trai has sent separate recommendations on the privacy and security aspects related to data that flow through telecom networks, while the draft ecommerce policy has elements related to data localisation and monetisation of public data.These proposed regulations overlap and in some cases even contradict, and these issues have been flagged by global companies such as Google and IBM. But recently, commerce minister Piyush Goyal directed his ministry to take out the data elements from the draft ecommerce policy, leaving the PDP Bill to handle those.“One thing everybody agrees on in the government is that there should be no overlap,” the second official said. The official said the national data governance centre will interact with all other government agencies who need any data. For instance, the road transport ministry might require data on traffic congestion or health ministry might require data on patients flow in certain hospitals.“Also, the government might decide on providing access of certain community data to Indian startups to foster and handhold them. Right now, there is no way any startup can get hold of such data, owing to which a handful of companies are monopolising all public data. This narrative will change,” the first official said. For example, Google collects all data on traffic, while companies such as Uber and Ola have data on traffic patterns.“Shouldn’t all this community or public data be available at one centralised location with the government, so that it can be used by everyone, including government agencies to make relevant laws and even help startups,” the official said, explaining the discussions underway in the government over the data policy.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-69984451,imgsize-345753,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/national-centre-being-planned-to-hold-and-manage-all-public-data.jpg",cio_etc_dc,"The government is planning to set up a national data governance centre to hold all public data , and establish guidelines for the management, sharing and monetisation of information.

Their first project, which has been underway for two months, is to develop an automated real-time email-communication solution for customer queries and reduce turn-around time on redressals, top executives from both companies told ET.“We are looking to improve speed, agility, consistency and quality of our communication channels,” said Mehmood Mansoori, member of executive management, HDFC ERGO. “The idea is to leverage IBM Watson technology to improve the overall experience and interface as we seek to improve our digital presence.”Neither IBM nor HDFC Ergo disclosed the investment figure for setting up the lab, even as the insurance subsidiary of HDFC called it “significant”.IBM Watson is a response-generating software developed by the New York-based IT giant, which using machine-learning and artificial intelligence (AI-ML) capabilities can create real-time custom responses and automate call-centre processes.“There are four to five layers of intervention in processing a customer complaint and giving a standard response, we want to deliver a full-blown solution without these layers.” said Kamal Singhani, managing partner, IBM India and South Asia. “We would run analytic models on large amounts of data footprints generated by customers to get a deeper understanding.”HDFC Ergo said the development is in line with their broader strategy of digitising operations to bring down operating cost. “Currently, about 65% of our post-issuance servicing is done online. Through this partnership we want to increase that to 85% by the end of the fiscal,” said Mansoori.The third-largest private general insurance company has a customer base of about 11 million and issued nearly 8.5 million policies last year, according to Mansoori. In spite of having a wide network of 15,000 agents, almost 95% of these policies were issued through paperless and automated streams, he said.“Chaining market dynamics have caused us to change our business model. We recognise ourselves more as a fintech now than a traditional insurance player,” Mansoori said. “We will move towards digitally-enabling our agents as well.”In the next phase of the project, the team will deploy deep learning technology to “decipher more about customers” and create personalised policy packages, IBM said.

"It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that our appraisal system , today, needs a reform. In the last decade, many organizations have turned to digital solutions and products. It has brought more objectivity, transparency, and merit into performance management . In other words, these solutions have resolved rudimentary issues in standardizing the process. The true challenge, yet, is to retain the human elements of an appraisal system.So, what should concern you more is: are such solutions working for you?There are certain problems in the appraisal system that tech solutions can resolve. Digital technology has, to an extent, simplified the offline process via software. Doing so makes it faster, error-free, and scalable. But, the real challenge comes in retaining the human angle within such processes. Every process has a contextual reference and involves high human-to-human interactions. Certain human biases can also affect the end-result of an appraisal.Until now, digital solutions have been able to judge:* Communication and workflow management* Collection of data which has an aim (such as ratings & option-based questions)* Data analysis of results and running algorithms to understand compensation and talent indexIn short, it is easy to replicate any logic with a controlled number of variables. Several organizations have attempted to evolve their appraisal systems based on simple techniques. Still, they have failed to do so as a large chunk of the process is a series of complex inputs, logic, and outputs. So, they have tried and fallen hard, back into their archaic methods.The inputs and their processing make the decision-making very complicated. And, so do the conversations and outcomes within an appraisal system. This is where Smart Analytics & AI comes into the picture.Let’s look at a few cases where AI/ML can make significant contributions to the appraisal system.* Framework-driven approach makes recognition of an employee’s efforts easier. It helps in organizing data for better analysis. For example, colleagues can celebrate exceptional performance. They can also suggest if there is a scope for improvement. Sentiment Analysis and NLP of organic user feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. It also gives real-time performance analysis.* AI-driven algorithm to give a continuous work-life score to the employees. It is also not a recency biased, once-a-year rating.* Deep API-integrations with work tools such as Gmail, Google Calendars, Slack, and many more in the future. It can curate scattered feedback in one place. It can also lend more efficient insights into an employee’s performance over a given period.* Analytics helps the user to get the most from the feedback. It guides how to improve rather than informing how one failed. This has a constructive impact on an employee’s productivity. Artificial Intelligence has reduced the time to give/view/take action on feedback. This holds for both employees and the HR manager.* Suggestions on target users to cheer(recognize) and boost(constructive feedback)* Suggestions on skills/badges* Feedback reminders* Project feed* Activity feed reminders for Calendar/Jira tasks.New-age technologies have amplified the performance assessment process. And, they have taken it way beyond the traditional indicators. This intervention has made the experience constructive and meaningful across workplaces. Who knows?

"Robots that can cook - from flipping burgers to baking bread - are in growing demand as virus-wary kitchens try to put some distance between workers and customers. Starting this fall, the White Castle burger chain will test a robot arm that can cook french fries and other foods. The robot, dubbed Flippy, is made by Pasadena, California-based Miso Robotics.White Castle and Miso have been discussing a partnership for about a year. Those talks accelerated when COVID-19 struck, said White Castle Vice President Jamie Richardson.Richardson said the robot can free up employees for other tasks like disinfecting tables or handling the rising number of delivery orders. A touch-free environment that minimizes contact is also increasingly important to customers, he said.""The world's just reshaped in terms of thoughts around food safety,"" Richardson said.Flippy currently costs USD 30,000, with a USD 1,500 monthly service fee. By the middle of next year, Miso hopes to offer the robot for free but charge a higher monthly fee. Robot food service was a trend even before the coronavirus pandemic , as hospitals, campus cafeterias and others tried to meet demand for fresh, customised options 24 hours a day while keeping labour costs in check. Robot chefs appeared at places like Creator, a burger restaurant in San Francisco, and Dal.komm Coffee outlets in South Korea.Now, some say, robots may shift from being a novelty to a necessity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the risk of getting COVID-19 from handling or consuming food outside the home is low. Still, there have been numerous outbreaks among restaurant employees and patrons.""I expect in the next two years you will see pretty significant robotic adoption in the food space because of COVID,"" said Vipin Jain, the co-founder and CEO of Blendid, a Silicon Valley startup.Blendid sells a robot kiosk that makes a variety of fresh smoothies. Customers can order from a smartphone app and tweak the recipe if they want more kale or less ginger, for example. Once or twice a day, a Blendid employee refills the ingredients.Only a handful are now operating around San Francisco, but since the pandemic began, Blendid has started contract discussions with hospitals, corporations, shopping malls and groceries.""What used to be forward-thinking - last year, pre-COVID - has become current thinking,"" Jain said.As salad bars shut down, Hayward, California-based Chowbotics started getting more inquiries about Sally, a robot about the size of a refrigerator that makes a variety of salads and bowls. Sally lets customers choose from 22 prepared ingredients stored inside the machine. It can make around 65 bowls a day before kitchen workers need to refill the ingredients.Prior to this year, Chowbotics had sold around 125 of its $35,000 robots, primarily to hospitals and colleges. But since the coronavirus hit, sales have jumped more than 60%, CEO Rick Wilmer said, with growing interest from grocery stores, senior living communities and even the U.S. Department of Defence.Wilkinson Baking Co., whose BreadBot mixes, forms and bakes loaves of bread, has also been getting more inquiries.Randall Wilkinson, the CEO of the Walla Walla, Washington-based company, said the BreadBot serves shifting needs. Grocery shoppers no longer want self-serve options like olive bars, but they still want fresh and local food. Seeing how that food is made also gives them more confidence, he said. Robot cooks haven't always been successful. Spyce, a Boston restaurant with a robot-run kitchen, closed in November to retool its menu. Zume, a Silicon Valley startup that made pizzas with robots, shut down its pizza business in January. It's now making face masks and biodegradable takeout containers.Max Elder, research director of the Food Futures Lab at the Palo Alto, California-based Institute for the Future, is skeptical about the future of food prep robots once the pandemic has eased.""Food is so personal, and it needs to involve humans,"" he said.Elder is also concerned that focusing on automating food preparation during the pandemic will shift attention from other problems in the food system, like outbreaks among meat industry workers or produce pickers.""We can't automate our way out of the pandemic because the pandemic affects much more than what can be automated,"" Elder said.Automated food companies insist they're not trying to replace human workers. At White Castle, Richardson says Flippy will allow managers to redeploy workers to drive-thru lanes or help them cover a shift if an employee calls in sick. Wilmer, of Chowbotics, says Sally may actually create jobs, since it keeps selling food at times of day when it wouldn't have been available before.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76976623,imgsize-395199,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/demand-for-robot-cooks-rises-as-kitchens-combat-covid-19-in-the-us.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"Robots that can cook - from flipping burgers to baking bread - are in growing demand as virus-wary kitchens try to put some distance between workers and customers.

"WASHINGTON DC: Rejecting the large range of unstable possibilities, all the configurations that would lead to collisions would leave behind a sharper view of planetary systems around other stars, but it's not as easy as it sounds.""Separating the stable from the unstable configurations turns out to be a fascinating and brutally hard problem,"" said Daniel Tamayo, a NASA Hubble Fellowship Program Sagan Fellow in astrophysical sciences at Princeton.To make sure a planetary system is stable, astronomers need to calculate the motions of multiple interacting planets over billions of years and check each possible configuration for stability -- a computationally prohibitive undertaking.Astronomers since Isaac Newton have wrestled with the problem of orbital stability, but while the struggle contributed to many mathematical revolutions, including calculus and chaos theory , no one has found a way to predict stable configurations theoretically. Modern astronomers still have to 'brute-force' the calculations, albeit with supercomputers instead of abaci or slide rules.Tamayo and his colleagues realized that they could accelerate the process by combining simplified models of planets' dynamical interactions with machine learning methods. This allows the elimination of huge swaths of unstable orbital configurations quickly -- calculations that would have taken tens of thousands of hours can now be done in minutes.He is the lead author on a paper detailing the approach in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Co-authors of the new study include David Spergel, director of the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) in New York City, as well as CCA group leaders Phil Armitage and Shirley Ho.""Despite centuries of effort, the mechanisms that drive planetary systems unstable remain debated,"" Armitage said.The new work ""demonstrates that by combining our hard-won understanding of planetary dynamics with modern machine learning techniques, we can reliably predict the fate of an abundant class of known extrasolar planetary systems.""For most multi-planet systems, there are many orbital configurations that are possible given current observational data, of which not all will be stable. Many configurations that are theoretically possible would 'quickly' -- that is, in not too many millions of years -- destabilize into a tangle of crossing orbits. The goal was to rule out those so-called 'fast instabilities.'""We can't categorically say 'This system will be OK, but that one will blow up soon,'"" Tamayo said. ""The goal instead is, for a given system, to rule out all the unstable possibilities that would have already collided and couldn't exist at the present day.""Instead of simulating a given configuration for a billion orbits -- the traditional brute-force approach, which would take about 10 hours -- Tamayo's model instead simulates for 10,000 orbits, which only takes a fraction of a second.From this short snippet, they calculate 10 summary metrics that capture the system's resonant dynamics. Finally, they train a machine learning algorithm to predict from these 10 features whether the configuration would remain stable if they let it keep going out to one billion orbits.""We called the model SPOCK -- Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier -- partly because the model determines whether systems will 'live long and prosper,'"" Tamayo said.SPOCK determines the long-term stability of planetary configurations about 100,000 times faster than the previous approach, breaking the computational bottleneck. ""Machine learning methods have opened up new ground in what we can do in inferring the properties of planetary systems,"" Ho said.Tamayo cautions that while he and his colleagues haven't 'solved' the general problem of planetary stability, SPOCK does reliably identify fast instabilities in compact systems, which they argue are the most important in trying to do stability constrained characterization.""This new method will provide a clearer window into the orbital architectures of planetary systems beyond our own,"" Tamayo said.In the past 25 years, astronomers have found more than 4,000 planets orbiting other stars, of which almost half are in multi-planet systems. But since small exoplanets are extremely challenging to detect, we still have an incomplete picture of their orbital configurations.""More than 700 stars are now known to have two or more planets orbiting around them,"" said Michael Strauss, chair of Princeton's Department of Astrophysical Sciences.""Dan and his colleagues have found a fundamentally new way to explore the dynamics of these multi-planet systems, speeding up the computer time needed to make models by factors of 100,000. With this, we can hope to understand in detail the full range of solar system architectures that nature allows,"" added Strauss.SPOCK is especially helpful for making sense of some of the faint, far-distant planetary systems recently spotted by the Kepler telescope , says Jessie Christiansen, an astrophysicist with the NASA Exoplanet Archive who was not involved in this research.""It's hard to constrain their properties with our current instruments,"" she said.""Are they rocky planets, ice giants, or gas giants? Or something new? This new tool will allow us to rule out potential planet compositions and configurations that would be dynamically unstable -- and it lets us do it more precisely and on a substantially larger scale than was previously available,"" she added.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76955914,imgsize-229164,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/artificial-intelligence-predicts-which-planetary-systems-will-survive.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"WASHINGTON DC: Rejecting the large range of unstable possibilities, all the configurations that would lead to collisions would leave behind a sharper view of planetary systems around other stars, but it's not as easy as it sounds.

"In the era of Industry 4.0 interconnected cyber physical systems, automation and robotic systems have been getting deployed across industries with increasing frequency. The growth in these systems can be attributed to several benefits they provide like automated production lines; productivity improvements in manufacturing, supply chain, and logistics; increased human safety in dangerous workplaces; working with accuracy and high precision in repetitive tasks and exploring unknown areas that are challenging to human beings. In the last few decades has seen steady growth in demand for automation and robots are now even used to mop the floor, preparing food, medical precision surgeries, exploring space and can be seen in humanoid avatars.As per 2019 report of World Robotics, the automotive industry remains the largest customer industry with 30% of total installations, ahead of electrical/electronics (25%), metal and machinery (10%), plastics and chemical products (5%) and food and beverages (3%). Since 2010, demand for industrial robots has risen considerably due to the ongoing trend toward automation and continued technical innovations in robots. The current generation of robots uses advanced technology features that provide better computational capabilities, improved camera visions, and the ability to perform different operations in complex environments.Amidst struggling global economic growth at the inception of 2020, the world has got adversely impacted by the pandemic of Covid19 that has brought the economic activities and plant operations to a grinding halt. The problem of human to human transmission and the requirement of social distancing is posing challenges. The impact on business and the global economy has been severe. The manufacturing companies had to shut down and scale down their plant operations during lockdowns and the gradual resumption of operations is only now beginning to take place.The work resumption has challenges where the safety and health of employees are paramount and the availability of skilled workers in the factories continues to be an issue. Given that cure is distant away, new ways are being explored and adopted in all spheres of life- business, education, healthcare, polity, and society to resume economic activity.In the post Covid19 scenario, the use of automation and robotics is likely to increase as it can reduce the disruptions to plant operations, increase productivity, and reduce risks associated with health and availability of labor. Many OEMs are already using robotics and automation in a big way and this trend will be accelerated further to manage and maintain their plant assets. One will also see increased adoption by Tier-1 players who might adopt these technologies and leverage IoT and digital assets more effectively. The Covid19 disruption will further accelerate digitization and the tasks where human contact is close will be automated to the maximum possible extent.Since the outbreak of Covid19 in China, many companies are adopting automation and robotics in a big way. During the outbreak, consumer electronic companies in semiconductor and flat panel display who had a high level of automation and robotics could minimize the disruption to their production schedules. The companies globally are likely to follow this trend in the coming years.The adoption of collaborative robots or cobots will get a boost post Covid 19, especially by midsize and smaller manufacturing companies. The portability, multi-use and programming of these robots enable them to perform a variety of functions on the production line and can work seamlessly with humans in manufacturing setups.With Covid19 driving work from home practices, industry sectors, apart from automotive and electronics, will see increased adoption of automation. Banking, hotels and restaurants, and customer service companies will see the use of robotic software and hardware technologies driving automation to reduce human interactions wherever possible. Medical surgery and healthcare sectors will see increased adoption and use where such automation and robots can reduce the requirements of healthcare workers in contact with ill patients.With the Industry 4.0 driving digital transformation across industries, the post Covid19 will provide further impetus to the development of automation and robotics field using technologies of artificial intelligence deep learning , and Big Data. These technologies will make use of automation and robots flexible and agile that can adapt and perform different functions and roles in an integrated manner. The future of automation and robotics evolution is accelerating towards complete digital factories and workplaces. With this, requirements for qualified and experienced engineers and skilled staff who can develop, deploy, and maintain these automation and robotics products will significantly increase post Covid19.With all its obvious benefits, a lot will depend on how long it takes in the revival of growth post Covid19 and economics of doing business. But the trend towards adoption of automation and robotics will accelerate as companies, businesses and nations work for minimal disruptions to their economic growth and health and safety of citizens.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76885478,imgsize-44276,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/automation-and-robotics-increased-visibility-post-covid19.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"In the era of Industry 4.0 interconnected cyber physical systems, automation and robotic systems have been getting deployed across industries with increasing frequency.

"On May 12, 2020 in his 8 p.m. address to the nation, Hon’ble Prime Minister - Shri Narendra Modi spoke at length about modernizing the supply chain . He went on to name it one of the five important pillars of any economy, and that we must utilize it to benefit the economy. There is no doubt that logistics and supply chain have been one of the backbones of the economy.If we closely monitor the current situation of the coronavirus induced pandemic, last mile delivery of essentials has been one of the most sought-after service and even the trickiest to be managed of all. Reasons being the potential contact and an overwhelming supply mandate. But that is a separate topic altogether.Firstly, let us fathom the depths of the Indian e-commerce marketplace. Investment bank Morgan Stanley has said, in its report, that India’s e-commerce industry is expected to reach a gross merchandise value of $200bn by 2026, and logistics, in such a case, would be a critical enabler for a successful e-commerce business continuity . And when technology integration and implementation of a logistics player is in sync with the fast-changing needs of end consumers, it is bound to propel evolving trends in e-commerce.The tech enabled logistics players are bound to become catalysts in improving the last mile delivery experience, something which has the potential to make or break the industry earnings. The end consumer experience at the last mile touch point is the moment that defines and spurs the growth of e-commerce industry.As one can see even during Covid times, how everything technology taken a lead, in every purchase we make online. In the wake of a Covid-marred world, the last mile delivery has improved, rather evolved through several tech measures taken to ensure that the impact of pandemic is kept limited.With key initiative of contactless delivery, logistics has taken the digital technology route by converting the CoD shipment to an alternate digital payment mode dynamically when shipment is in its last leg, thereby assuring consumers of safety in containment protocols. They are being protected by Secured Delivery Code (OTP) for high-value shipments delivery to skip taking the customer’s signature at the last touchpoint.This move has not only brought agility to the process given the pandemic related dynamics but also presented an opportunity to automate everything while shipment is still in transit. For instance, services such as automated notifications are opportunities that augment and support productivity and efficiency in support of improved service deliverables and turn-around times.Such initiatives showcase a huge shift in the logistics space where the e-commerce delivery is not merely a push-based mechanism, but more responsive, time-bound and has a strict adherence to service-level agreements that begins the moment a customer makes a purchase online, backed by technology.Moreover, customers have an emotional moment when they receive the much-awaited product that they ordered. Last mile delivery is not just about when the product gets delivered but also how they get delivered. As the demands get higher and the e-commerce industry adopts a more technically advanced solutions, logistics providers too, get a great opportunity to reinvent their offerings in assuring better consumer experience. Because the consumer would expect convenience, speed, efficiency, aesthetics, efficiency, professional conduct and a clear communication throughout the life cycle of the order till the last mile.In its recent report “E-commerce retail logistics in India”, KPMG in the next 5 years projected a CAGR of about 36 per cent in the e-commerce driven logistics space. The report added that logistics requirements for the e-commerce sector are getting reshaped by continuously evolving business demands. This is further enabled by the rapid proliferation of connected technologies and advancement in automation. All these are ushering new innovations in logistics.Another significant aspect of technology is data, considered to be the new natural resource for businesses to thrive and drive efficiencies. This data is as important for logistics supply chain companies as it is for e-commerce companies. For logistics, this data can be harnessed to track and monitor shipment life cycle and also in applying key performance indicators across various metrics to continuously improve and allow companies to optimize their resources, make better predictions and enhance overall deliverables around speed, reliability and efficiency.During these unprecedented times, there is a massive stress on the economy around supply chain, be it the essentials or the important non-essentials. The supply chain logistics will need to be strong in order to endure such an upscale. Innovative solutions driven by technology, its integration and standardization will further enable logistics providers in fulfilling last mile delivery. It is about time to relook at involving technology for improving last mile logistics during Covid times.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76866213,imgsize-417669,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/tech-to-reshape-the-future-of-last-mile-logistics.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"On May 12, 2020 in his 8 p.m. address to the nation, Hon’ble Prime Minister - Shri Narendra Modi spoke at length about modernizing the supply chain .

"Words fail to capture the enormity of the crisis that COVID-19 has brought in its wake. Enterprise efforts are increasingly focusing on people safety and continuity of business. Companies across the globe have adopted a remote work model to keep the business running. As companies struggle to get a sense of the revenue impact, focusing on how to boost their transformation using digital technologies, has now become more important than ever before. As technology has evolved and automation has taken centre stage, the integration of automation with intelligence, resulting in Hyper Automation has significant implications for how businesses will operate in the future.Emerging technologies such as Data & Analytics, AI, Big Data Analytics, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks, Deep Learning-powered Image Recognition , Statistical ML and Natural Language Processing (NLP) added to Automation, is helping organisations execute several tasks. These technologies are enabling the delivery of tasks with efficiency and accuracy, resulting superior business outcomes and better customer experience. This process called Hyper Automation is also known as Smart or Cognitive Automation.The ability to improve the quality of employee engagement , customer experience and the need to improve operational and service performances are some of the more prominent drivers of Hyper Automation.Enterprises are excited with the advancements as newer technologies are being introduced; however, these overwhelming developments need a framework with which to strategize, track and effectively utilize Hyper Automation in organizations. This can be built by using the four-phase framework of Think-Design-Build-Sustain.Think phase - Saving time, driving successBefore deploying Hyper Automation, it is necessary to analyze the exact use case beneﬁts desired from its application. The consequence of missing out on this important step is a huge set back in terms of resources, revenue and time spent. This could have an enormous negative impact on the company and decreases overall faith in the digital transformation journey for the organization.The base of a successful and effective Hyper Automation project is founded on pre -requisites such as data acquisition, ingestion, cleaning, integration, storage, governance, protection and consumption, married with superior design considerations. A projects success will depend on all the systems working seamlessly with each other. This entails having multiple domain experts working together to achieve the end goal. Having one agreed upon handbook for the project could go a long way in ensuring that the use case objectives are met with success.With use case considerations being a major factor in the success of a cognitive automation project, let’s look at what goes into selecting potential use cases.Most Cognitive Automation programs when starting out go for projects with lower risk and where outcomes are estimated to be easier to achieve. A large majority also use a highly data intensive exercise to validate and qualify use cases. This shows that there is no single methodology that works for everyone. One important point to be noted is that use case identification should be driven by business rather than by the technology.One technology challenge that may come up with AI use cases is the difficulty of explaining how an intelligent system reached a particular decision. In such instances, using an Explainable AI (XAI) model to highlight the goals and decision-making process would help justify decisions.Project execution of AI and Automation needs a different approach unlike other projects as it involves speciﬁc data, domain and technology complexities. Clear objectives should be outlined at the onset of the project and domain experts should closely monitor the pilot for success. Only post meeting these objectives successfully should the pilot be scaled up. Systems that control and have compliance capabilities pre- and post-deployment will provide assurance to customers that their systems will not spring any nasty surprises.Security: In terms of security, it’s important to monitor certain factors to keep a project on track. One factor is Prediction Bias whereby by regularly examining the distribution of predicted labels versus the observed labels, we can check and verify anomalies, when there is any observable change in metrics. Another check could be on Action Limits which get activated for each use case. A violation of these limits could lead to manual involvement before the start of the next step.Governance: Multiple checks and balances are essential as part of the governance process to manage risks when considering Hyper Automation programs. Some recommended criteria for good governance are as follows:Slow and calculated approach: For unproven use cases a PoC (Proof of Concept), a pilot, and a phase-wise implementation strategy is recommended. At least one of the environments in the pre-production phase should have as-is production data while testing the AI use cases.Explainability: When moving deep into automation adoption, the question of trust and making sure organizations understand every step taken by AI algorithms to ensure unbiased decision making, arises frequently. This is called ’Explainability’ which is necessary to assuage concerns around data security or ethical norms.The very nature of AI models means one must be ready for surprises at intervals as multiple segments including data will constantly change and evolve over the course of time. AI and Automation projects will therefore need constant monitoring and effort to keep them running optimally. As no single system of governance for this process exists as yet, it is important that enterprises have a dedicated unit to constantly monitor the AI and Automation processes, comprised of experts in enterprise architecture , data scientists and data engineer alongside software engineers, testers and the like.It is most likely that current technology trends such as AutoML, Edge AI, AI and IOT Continuum, Federated Learning and Synthetic Data will drive the increased use of Hyper Automation. The adoption of AI in the enterprise community has increased exponentially and it is a given that AI solutions will continue to be incubated, evaluated and rolled out. However, the objective might change. It could go from being just cost impact solutions to solutions that would work with humans to augment their effort and improve the end users experience.Hyper Automation has the potential to trigger deep and large-scale transformation across infrastructure, processes and market strategies. The organization needs to take an informed call on when pilots have served their purpose and expand the scope of Hyper Automation across the company. New tools, processes and talent will inevitably become a huge burden for the enterprise however, that will have to be absorbed in stride, if the next phase of progress is to be achieved.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76846044,imgsize-241207,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/hyper-automation-giving-customers-the-crucial-edge-in-business-transformation.jpg",cio_etc_cc,Words fail to capture the enormity of the crisis that COVID-19 has brought in its wake.

"NEW DELHI: Volkswagen has announced that it will be introducing the ' Computer Vision ' AI technology to boost its production by at least 30 percent by the year 2025.Currently, the 'Industrial Computer Vision' image recognition and processing technology is being tested at the Porsche's Leipzig plant, informed Volkswagen AG.As the German automobile giant said, the Computer Vision technology extracts information from optical data. Then it analyzes and evaluates the retracted data using Artificial Intelligence (AI).The automaker says that it has set up a team of about 60 Computer Vision experts for further development of the technology and the evaluation of new utilization possibilities.As VW claims, the procedure to retract, analyze and evaluation of data is similar to the human capability of recognizing, processing and analyzing images. The automaker is claimed to be working with this technology for several years and is now intensifying its efforts in order to boost the production in coming years and also to make the product manufacturing more efficient.Volkswagen AG says that first two Computer Vision solutions from the group companies Porsche and Audi are currently being prepared for the group-wide rollout.At the Audi Ingolstadt plant, the luxury carmaker uses the technology for quality testing at the press shop, where cameras are combined with software based on machine learning to detect the finest cracks and defects in the components.Commenting on this, Gerd Walker, Head of Volkswagen Group Production, said, ""The use of this technology offers considerable potential for making our production plants even more efficient.

"Marriages might be made in heaven, but technology will lead to your partner on earth. With close to 4 million customers on board, with an addition of 30,000 daily, Matrimony.com is a preferred matchmaking website in the country. But a large customer base is at times a double-edged sword too. What transpires is a question of providing a relevant match to a customer and market the right service to the latter.Chandrasekar R, Chief Technology Operation and Infrastructure Officer, Matrimony.com relied on artificial intelligence to solve multiple customer centric equations. One is to identify a potential customer who is likely to subscribe to the range of services. “Based on the new profile data we feed it into the model. We have with us the last 20 years of data. That is in our analytical platform . Now we use the AI, ML and using the existing data, whenever there is a new customer arrival we predict whether the customer is likely to subscribe to our service,” he says.AI model is integrated with the CRM. It also helps in the marketing campaign . It helps them segment the customer. “Based on this segmentation, we do a personalized campaign to the customer. By looking at the demographic data and also segmentation which the AI model gives we pitch the right and relevant product to the customer across the platform,” Chandrasekar adds.Another purpose was to avoid duplication of a profile. “Assume you get a new photograph from the customer. Manually scanning through the million profiles for duplication is an impossible manual task. Any photo that comes in is matched with the existing coordinates stored internally,” he says. It has brought in a lot of efficiency to the process and helps eliminate the duplicate profile, he adds.Chandrasekar is also developing a recommendation engine. “All our customers give their preference for the search or match making. It could be religion, mother tongue, etc. while doing the registration. Recommendation is based on these parameters. Recommendation engine was developed some time back. It looks at the behavior of each user and based on past activity we identify suitable profiles. We are improvising the engine now,” he says.For all the services Matrimony.com has a private cloud to service the customers. “And now courtesy AI, ML, we have added a few more GPUs to help this initiative. We are also working on a hybrid cloud environment, rather than relying only on private cloud. This helps us leverage public cloud available with the major service providers on a need basis,” he says.Chandrasekar believes that personalized matchmaking will see an improvement in the coming days. “Rather than the number of profiles and matches to be provided, we want them to be relevant to the customers,” he says.Another move would be from text-based chat to video. “Customer service will be handled through chatbots. Though long way to go, chatbots can replace agents to a large extent,” he says.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76542617,imgsize-15877,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/matrimony-com-relies-on-ai-to-find-a-better-half.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"Marriages might be made in heaven, but technology will lead to your partner on earth.

"Amazon Web Services and Formula One Group are introducing six new, real-time racing statistics that will roll out through the 2020 season, beginning with the launch of “Car Performance Scores” at the season opening Grand Prix in Spielberg, Austria July 3-5. “Car Performance Scores” isolate an individual car’s performance and allows race fans to compare its performance to that of different vehicles head-to-head. The new set of statistics to be released this season will use a range of AWS services, including machine learning , to give fans the ability to compare their favorite drivers and cars and better predict race outcomes.With 300 sensors on each F1 race car generating more than 1.1M data points per second transmitted from the cars to the pit, Formula 1 is a truly data-driven sport where much of the thrill comes from extracting exciting details on performance statistics. F1 relies on the breadth and depth of AWS services to stream, process, and analyze that flood of data in real-time, and then present it in a meaningful way for F1 global TV viewers. The new “Car Performance Scores” insight will display as an on-screen graphic that provides fans with a complete breakdown of a car’s total performance using four core metrics: Low-Speed Cornering, High-Speed Cornering, Straight Line, and Car Handling. The new graphic will illustrate how those metrics compare from one car to another, enabling race fans to gauge a given car’s relative performance in those different areas and see where each team and driver is leading the pack or losing crucial time to their rivals.F1 and AWS previously announced six F1 Insights, including Exit Speed, Predicted Pit Stop Strategy, Pit Window, Battle Forecast, Pit Strategy Battle, and Tyre Performance and will roll out the following six additional “F1 Insights powered by AWS” stats as on-screen graphics from July through December of this season, offering fans more visibility into the split-second decision-making and action on the track, as well as behind the pit wall where the team strategists operate:Car Performance Scores: Isolates an individual car’s performance and allows race fans to compare its performance to that of different vehicles head-to-head (debuts July 3-5 at the FORMULA 1 ROLEX GROSSER PREIS VON ÖSTERREICH GRAND PRIX 2020).Ultimate Driver Speed Comparison: Allows race fans to see how their favorite drivers compare to other drivers in history, dating back to 1983, to help determine the fastest driver of all time (debuts August 7-9 at the EMIRATES FORMULA 1 70th ANNIVERSARY GRAND PRIX 2020).High-Speed/Low-Speed Corner Performance: Allows fans to see how well drivers tackle the fastest bends on the track travelling at more than 175 kph/109 mph and slow cornering (below 125 kph/78 mph) compared to other vehicles, which is critical to lap time (debuts August 28-30 at the FORMULA 1 ROLEX BELGIAN GRAND PRIX).Driver Skills Rating: Breaks down and scores driver skills, based on the most important factors for overall performance, to help identify the best “total driver” on the track. By calculating varying subsets of qualifying round performance, starts, race pace, tire management, and overtaking/defending styles, this insight will provide an overall driver ranking (debuts the second half of the season).Car/Team Development & Overall Season Performance: As the season unfolds, this will plot a team’s cumulative performance from race to race to uncover the development rates of each team (debuts the second half of the season).Qualifying and Race Pace Predictions: Gather data from practice and qualifying laps to predict which team is poised for success ahead of each race session. These predictions will create heightened intrigue and excitement for the Saturday qualifying session and Sunday race (debuts the second half of the season).To create these new insights, Formula 1 will use 70 years of historical race data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), combined with live data that is streamed from sensors on F1 race cars and the trackside to the cloud through Amazon Kinesis, a service for real-time data collection, processing, and analysis. F1 engineers and scientists will use this data to leverage machine learning (ML) models with Amazon SageMaker, AWS’s service for building, training, and deploying ML models. F1 is able to analyze race performance metrics in real-time by deploying those ML models on AWS Lambda, which runs code without the need to provision or manage servers. All of the insights will be integrated into the international broadcast feed of F1 races around the globe, including its digital platform F1.tv, helping fans to understand the split-second decisions and race strategies made by drivers or team strategists that can dramatically affect a race outcome.“Over the past two years, Formula 1 has embraced AWS’s services to perform intense and dynamic data analysis. The F1 Insights we’re delivering together are bringing fans closer to the track than ever before, and unlocking previously untold stories and insights from behind the pit wall,” said Rob Smedley, Chief Engineer of Formula 1. “We’re excited to be expanding this successful relationship to bring even more insights to life, allowing fans to go deeper into the many ways that drivers and racing teams work together to affect success.”“Formula 1 racing mixes physics and human performance, yielding powerful, but complex data that AWS is helping them to harness. Our existing relationship with F1 has already produced statistics that have brought fans into the race paddocks, and our study of race car aerodynamics is influencing vehicle designs for the 2022 season,” said Mike Clayville, Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Sales at AWS. “This year, we’re thrilled to extend the power of F1 data in the cloud and unlock new insights that help fans understand more of F1’s rich complexity.”",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76530898,imgsize-225075,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/aws-and-formula-1-announce-new-racing-performance-stats-for-2020-season.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"Amazon Web Services and Formula One Group are introducing six new, real-time racing statistics that will roll out through the 2020 season, beginning with the launch of “Car Performance Scores” at the season opening Grand Prix in Spielberg, Austria July 3-5. “Car Performance Scores” isolate an individual car’s performance and allows race fans to compare its performance to that of different vehicles head-to-head.","AWS: AWS and Formula 1 announce new racing performance stats for 2020 season, IT News, ET CIO",https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/next-gen-technologies/76530898?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=ETRSS
"The adoption of AI is increasing rapidly across the world with no industry remaining untouched by its impact. Most enterprises are already in agreement that artificial intelligence can bring unparalleled value to their organisation. However, the concerns over bias in AI systems and their efficiency are also not new.A recent study shows that while 67 percent of consumers worry about AI discriminating against them, and 64 percent fear that AI will make decisions that affect them without their knowledge. Sanjay Srivastava , CDO at Genpact doesn’t think of AI as artificial intelligence, he thinks of it as augmented intelligence - which augments a human’s capabilities with machine learning and AI for example.AI and data analytics can bring possible solutions to us at amazing speed, but ‘the last mile,’ the actual decision, he believes, still belongs to humans only and it is how enterprises can truly act with confidence.One way to think about this is AI is a prediction capability – and as good as it can be, it will always require judgment and action in responding to that prediction – something that will always fall back to humans. This is the concept of “humans in the loop” and in the end, ensures the proper use of augmented intelligence.But like anything else, you need to be thoughtful about how and where you apply AI. For example, in governance and ethics: Consumers and governments alike are becoming increasingly concerned about how data is being used by AI-driven technologies. The concerns are so great – with issues ranging from algorithms that drive credit limits, to the use of facial recognition software for myriad reasons – that governmental bodies around the world are taking action.To help eliminate stakeholders’ and consumers’ worries about unethical or biased data use, we expect that many organizations will add Digital Ethics Officers to their leadership team. These officers will have multiple responsibilities: implementing ethical frameworks to make appropriate decisions about new technologies; addressing considerations like data security and bias; looking ahead to future technology challenges; building new standards of technology governance; and establishing new check-and-balance systems to ensure preventative measures remain effectiveChallenge in adoption and need for modularization: The top barriers to AI adoption are the lack of skills to design, implement, and maintain AI solutions, and no clarity on where to use AI effectively. And so, we need to think about AI in modules – in small components that can re-aggregate into larger business processes.I foresee that corporate boards are going to start thinking about ethical governance very differently.As AI continues to increase its influence on business decisions, governments are taking steps to ensure that all AI usage is ethical. There is a need to establish ethical AI frameworks for effective decision-making without misuse of data. With these frameworks, businesses can build trust with consumers, which supports AI adoption, but also brand reputation.As part of ethical AI frameworks, business leaders must encourage diversity. The goal is to have complete and comprehensive data samples that can cover all scenarios and users to eliminate bias. If we lack comprehensive data, external sources of synthetic data can fill in the gaps. Likewise, we should aim to have diverse teams with a wide range of skills and backgrounds, including digital and industry talent – or better yet, people who can think from both sides.Now more than ever, consumers expect business to do the right thing in all facets of their operations, and they will reward those that do so. Keeping ethics at the center of operations and technology implementation is essential.AI will have an impact on jobs, but not what most people think. My view is that the future of work will be less about AI impacting the number of jobs, and more about the need for humans to adapt their skill sets to leverage this digital age.The successful workforce of the future will bring a trainable and curious mindset. Workers shouldn’t fear AI or disruption but adopt a “trainable” and continuously curious mindset to prepare for a future of constant skills development and retraining.Additionally, the way we learn will change, and businesses will put a greater emphasis on reskilling, upskilling and virtual training. However, mandated, one-size-fits-all reskilling and training programs don’t enable employees to discover their skills, identify their gaps, and hone their potential through customized knowledge paths and plans.With Genome, Genpact’s internal learning framework, we are continuously preparing internally for the future of work by enabling our talent to acquire new skills and evolve quickly as industries and technologies change. Genome harnesses the collective intelligence of Genpact’s more than 90,000 employees.Genpact also announced that it is opening part of its internal learning platform, Genome, to the public at no cost.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76522411,imgsize-61449,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/forget-evil-tech-or-rogue-machines-here-are-the-real-concerns-of-ai-adoption.jpg",cio_etc_cc,The adoption of AI is increasing rapidly across the world with no industry remaining untouched by its impact.

"While Artificial Intelligence is becoming the game changer in cyber security and manufacturing, real estate has not been left untouched. There is no doubt that the acceptance and adoption of artificial intelligence in Indian real estate industry has been slow but it is being accelerated with covid coming into picture. Mahindra Lifespaces , the real estate and infrastructure development arm of Mahindra Group , plans to invest heavily in artificial intelligence to transform business and provide seamless customer experience.While speaking with ETCIO, Abhinav Aggarwal, Head-IT, Mahindra Lifespaces shares why the adoption of AI has been slow and how it is being picked by the industry now. He further goes on to explain how Mahindra Lifespaces plans to transform business with Artificial Intelligence.""In India, most real estate entities have been family owned and family run, historically. It is only in the recent times that these entities, while being family owned, are run professionally. Meaning a lot of real estate developers have spent considerable time in doing basic stuff, having a proper ERP, CRM platform, HRMS. This is why AI and ML were only buzzwords for us but now with the way professionals are managing this space, AI will change the game,"" said Aggarwal.Another reason he talks about is the amount of data. AI and ML concepts are nothing without data and real estate developers have struggled to collect the right amount of data.""Sales teams have historically been against collecting too much data because they just want the customer to come in, sign the cheque and leave,"" said Aggarwal.Now that Mahindra Lifespaces has collected data owing to the complete digital journey of customers, it is ready to adopt AI.The company is working on a tool which will help create what if scenarios for forecasting business.Citing an example here, Aggarwal said, ""We were to launch a project in the Q4 for FY 2020. Now because of Covid-19, we have to postpone it. The question is can I create these what-if scenarios and somehow predict different models which tell me what my cash flows would be if I were to change the product. How will delay impact cash flows, should we change the product or delay it even more? We are trying to create an application which essentially aggregates all the possible data we have internally then helps pull a few levers and help us recast the business plan for the year.""The company has implemented a project lifecycle management tool which is powered by AI. This helps them forecast delays in construction and pinpoints safety issues.""Most developers rely on Microsoft projects to create their construction schedules. We have taken that to next and we are trying to point to those tiny activities which no one has ever bothered about in the past which could actually delay the entire construction lifecycle of the project. We used this one project in the affordable space and we have now started horizontally deploying it for the premium segment as well,"" he explained.The other project that involves AI on the construction sites is to use CCTV camera feed to keep a check on security features at the site.""We would want to alert the safety teams who are monitoring the site if all the workers are wearing helmets, safety jackets and harnesses and if the safety nets are installed. We can monitor that on camera but can we trigger alerts to the safety managers real time basis the CCTV analysing the footage rather than the person continuously staring at the camera screen,"" Aggarwal said.Leveling up the customer experience, Mahindra Lifespaces wants to bring in a feature which helps the customer measure the apartment. Meaning that it will very quickly verify if the land is 800 sq mt as promised.The company also wants to use AR VR to enable the customer to visualize what an empty apartment would look like if they were to add furniture, modular components, and fixtures to it.""That recorded file could be given to the designer who will be able to execute it with perfection,"" Aggarwal concluded.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76502379,imgsize-53135,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/how-mahindra-lifespaces-is-transforming-business-with-ai.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"While Artificial Intelligence is becoming the game changer in cyber security and manufacturing, real estate has not been left untouched.

"IIT Madras and General Electric India Technology Centre ( GEITC ) are jointly developing a 3D printed combustor aimed at reducing weight and improving fuel efficiency in small aircraft and helicopter engines Both organisations are designing the combustor - the burner in a gas turbine engine, with nearly one-tenth of the parts as compared to traditional engines.The Rs 7.24 crore Uchhatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY) project is being carried out by the aerospace department at the Institute and is being funded by the government of India (75%) and GEITC (25%).""The fabricated combustor has only four parts whereas the same combustor, with conventional manufacturing, will have at least thirty parts,"" said Prof SR Chakravarthy, Faculty In-charge, National Centre for Combustion Research - NCCRD at IIT Madras.""The primary objective of this project is to reduce the length of the combustor, which will reduce its weight. It also reduces the fuel consumption of the engine,"" he said.The engine could also be used in power generation. In larger aircraft, it could be used as part of an auxiliary power unit (APU), as well as for distributed/decentralised power generation as in backup gensets, or in remote locations, or along with hybrid solar/wind smart grid solutions.While there have been several improved combustors designs recently, this project aims to further improve these metrics with a design that uses additive manufacturing technology and non-intrusive laser diagnostics.The project team has successfully completed testing three 8-cup full annular combustor configurations. The results show the feasibility of 30% reduction in length of a conventional rich burn combustor. Currently, the team is focussing on the optical diagnostics experiments where laser diagnostics tools are being used to understand the flow physics inside the combustor. These results will help optimize the performance and to probe any further possibilities of length reduction, the professor said.The size and weight of the engine would be the same depending upon how the combustor is designed to fit into the rest of the engine. The weight savings, however, will be on the raw material of fabrication in additive manufacturing. This could lead to a substantial drop in weight, as much as 50% when compared to conventional combustors.Further, Dr Chakravarthy said the additive manufacturing of the combustors which were tested for this project were outsourced to Indian suppliers. These suppliers, he said, were now capable of adapting additive techniques for geometries as complex as combustor domes and liner, which in turn would help in developing the country’s additive manufacturing infrastructure.A special feature of this project is that it marks the first time that a 3D printed full annular combustor was tested at actual turbine conditions in India. The lab, which is housed in the National Centre for Combustion Research and Development (NCCRD) at IIT-M also boasts of being the first in India to have a high pressure optically accessible combustor test rig and state of the art laser diagnostics tools under one roof.IIT-M has an IP rights share with GEITC and expects GEITC to immediately use this in their product. Going forward, Dr Chakravarthy said that if GEITC is not absorbing the technology, for whatever reason, they have the first right of refusal after a lock-in period for IIT-M to commercialise the IP. Commercialization will be in the form of licensing to similar such engine houses as GEITC or to a start-up to develop a product that could be incubated by IIT-M itself.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76475995,imgsize-318433,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/iit-madras-ge-tie-up-to-build-3d-printed-combustor.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"IIT Madras and General Electric India Technology Centre ( GEITC ) are jointly developing a 3D printed combustor aimed at reducing weight and improving fuel efficiency in small aircraft and helicopter engines Both organisations are designing the combustor - the burner in a gas turbine engine, with nearly one-tenth of the parts as compared to traditional engines.The Rs 7.24 crore Uchhatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY) project is being carried out by the aerospace department at the Institute and is being funded by the government of India (75%) and GEITC (25%).

"DETROIT: The latest challenge for the autonomous vehicle industry : How to assure passengers that the car they are getting in is virus free, even if it doesn't have a driver.Widespread use of autonomous vehicles already had been delayed by a March 2018 fatal crash involving an Uber test vehicle in Tempe, Arizona, forcing the industry to pause to make sure its vehicles are safe.Now it has to deal - just like other ride-hailing companies and traditional taxis - with passenger anxiety over getting into tight spaces with people who may have the virus, or after infected people who rode in the vehicles before them.An executive with self-driving car company Waymo said Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic forced it to put its limited ride service in the Phoenix area on hold to make sure human backup drivers and passengers were safe.The passenger-carrying service hasn't resumed yet, but testing restarted on May 8. Some of the rides were shifted toward delivery, Patrick Cadariu, Waymo's head of supply chain operations, said on a webinar.Waymo, a unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., has been running the service with selected riders since 2018, sometimes without human backup drivers. Waymo and outside supply companies are now focused on putting technologies in place to clean vehicles between rides, Cadariu said.The technologies, which he did not identify, have been ready for the last few years, he told the Society of Automotive Analysts' webinar.Waymo is looking at what to do between rides when there isn't time to return to a depot for a full cleaning, Cadariu said.""Those are the sort of questions that people are thinking through both at Waymo and outside of Waymo right now given how the pandemic has affected us and also our anxieties around germs,"" he said.The Arizona vehicles have been delivering school supplies, protective equipment and food for nonprofits in the meantime.Waymo, seen by many as the leader in autonomous vehicle technology, is a ways from running a large-scale ride-hailing service with its Chrysler Pacifica minivans and Jaguar I-Pace electric SUVs, he said, without giving a target date.""The way we scale our technology, the way we scale our business will be incremental, safe and thoughtful,"" said Cadariu, who also runs Waymo's Detroit factory where stock vehicles are modified with autonomous sensors and hardware.""We're really at just the beginning in terms of scale."" Waymo has gradually expanded its service around Phoenix and now can run autonomously in an area about the size of San Francisco, Cadariu said.The company said that before the pandemic, it was running 1,000 to 2,000 rides per week. Between 5% and 10% were fully autonomous without human safety drivers, Waymo said.The company, however, has yet to solve the difficult issue of self-driving vehicles in inclement weather. This despite its use of multiple laser, radar and camera sensors connected to artificial intelligence Cadariu said Waymo has a team in the Detroit area working on snow and wet roads, while other teams in Florida and San Francisco are figuring out heavy rain and fog.Waymo also is investing heavily in technology to keep sensors clean so they can always view the road, something it sees as important to reaching large-scale services, he said.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76461193,imgsize-482701,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/driver-free-but-virus-free-robo-cars-hit-new-speed-bump.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"DETROIT: The latest challenge for the autonomous vehicle industry : How to assure passengers that the car they are getting in is virus free, even if it doesn't have a driver.Widespread use of autonomous vehicles already had been delayed by a March 2018 fatal crash involving an Uber test vehicle in Tempe, Arizona, forcing the industry to pause to make sure its vehicles are safe.Now it has to deal - just like other ride-hailing companies and traditional taxis - with passenger anxiety over getting into tight spaces with people who may have the virus, or after infected people who rode in the vehicles before them.An executive with self-driving car company Waymo said Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic forced it to put its limited ride service in the Phoenix area on hold to make sure human backup drivers and passengers were safe.The passenger-carrying service hasn't resumed yet, but testing restarted on May 8. Some of the rides were shifted toward delivery, Patrick Cadariu, Waymo's head of supply chain operations, said on a webinar.Waymo, a unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., has been running the service with selected riders since 2018, sometimes without human backup drivers.","self-driving cars: Driver free but virus free?

"Intel has introduced its 3rd-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors enabling customers to accelerate the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics workloads running in data centres . Intel’s new 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable processors makes AI inference and training more widely deployable on general-purpose CPUs for applications that include image classification, recommendation engines, speech recognition and language modeling. Facebook had recently announced that 3rd-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors are the foundation for its newest Open Compute Platform (OCP) servers, and other leading CSPs, including Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, have announced they are adopting the next-generation processors.Intel is further extending its investment in built-in AI acceleration in the new 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors through the integration of bfloat16 support into the processor’s unique Intel DL Boost technology. Bfloat16 is a compact numeric format that uses half the bits as today’s FP32 format but achieves comparable model accuracy with minimal — if any — software changes required, claims the company.The addition of bfloat16 support accelerates both AI training and inference performance in the CPU. Intel-optimised distributions for leading deep learning frameworks (including TensorFlow and Pytorch) support bfloat16 and are available through the Intel AI Analytics toolkit. Intel also delivers bfloat16 optimisations into its OpenVINO toolkit and the ONNX Runtime environment to ease inference deployments.The 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code-named “Cooper Lake”) evolve Intel’s 4- and 8-socket processor offering. The processor is designed for deep learning, virtual machine (VM) density, in-memory database, mission-critical applications and analytics-intensive workloads.As part of the 3rd-gen Intel Xeon Scalable platform, the company also announced the Intel Optane persistent memory 200 series, providing customers up to 4.5TB of memory per socket to manage data intensive workloads, such as in-memory databases, dense virtualisation, analytics and high-powered computing.For systems that store data in all-flash arrays, Intel announced the availability of its next-generation high-capacity Intel 3D NAND SSDs, the Intel SSD D7-P5500 and P5600 . These 3D NAND SSDs are built with Intel’s latest triple-level cell (TLC) 3D NAND technology and an all-new low-latency PCIe controller to meet the intense IO requirements of AI and analytics workloads and advanced features to improve IT efficiency and data security.Intel also disclosed its upcoming Intel Stratix 10 NX FPGAs, its first AI-optimised FPGAs targeted for high-bandwidth, low-latency AI acceleration. Intel Stratix 10 NX FPGAs include integrated high-bandwidth memory (HBM), high-performance networking capabilities and new AI-optimised arithmetic blocks called AI Tensor Blocks, which contain dense arrays of lower-precision multipliers typically used for AI model arithmetic.",2020-07-21,"https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-76461092,imgsize-410916,width-800,height-434,overlay-etcio/intel-launches-3rd-gen-xeon-scalable-processors-to-help-businesses-deploy-ai-solutions-faster.jpg",cio_etc_cc,"Intel has introduced its 3rd-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors enabling customers to accelerate the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics workloads running in data centres .
