"India has identified at least four Chinese companies in India including Huawei that have connections with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and have been sharing crucial intel with it, India Today has reported.

According to the report, a 2017 Chinese Intelligence Law empowers government authorities to conduct raid on suspects while companies like Huawei, ZTE and TikTok provide intelligence for such raids. The companies are reportedly obliged to share information and cooperate with Chinese intel agencies irrespective of where they operate from.

""Any organisation or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law. The state protects individuals and organisations that support, assist and cooperate with national intelligence work,"" Article 7 of the law reads.

The four identified companies are -- Xindia Steels, Xinxing Cathay International Group, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), and Huawei.

The development comes weeks after Indian government banned 59 China-based apps that could be potential threat to nation's security and data.

Xindia Steels is a joint venture between India and China and has recently established an iron ore pelletisation unit in Karnataka.

Xinxing Cathay International Group, which is the main shareholder in Xindia Steels, also has its own manufacturing plant in Chhattisgarh.

While mobile phone giant Huawei has large sales operations in India, the CETC is going to invest $46 million in a 200 megawatt PV facility in Andhra Pradesh.

It is worth mentioning an interesting piece of information, that Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei was earlier a deputy director of the PLA's engineering corps. The CETC too has been a major military electronics maker for the PLA.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Swarajya,Four Chinese Companies In India May Be Sharing Intel With PLA; Centre Traces Links With Chinese Military,https://swarajyamag.com/insta/four-chinese-companies-in-india-may-be-sharing-intel-with-pla-centre-traces-links-with-chinese-military

Google has become the latest US technology giant to invest in Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries' digital business.

The Alphabet-owned search engine has agreed to pay $4.5bn (£3.6bn) for a 7.7% stake in Jio Platforms.

Reliance's billionaire owner Mukesh Ambani says the two companies will develop phones for 4G and 5G networks.

Google joins a list of new investors in Jio that includes Facebook, Intel and Qualcomm.

""Google has empowered millions of Indians to access helpful information and, like Jio, is a force for change and innovation,"" Mr Ambani said in a statement to shareholders.

Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai said: ""The pace and scale of digital transformation in India is hugely inspiring for us and reinforces our view that building products for India first helps us build better products for users everywhere.""

Earlier this week Google also said the company would invest about $10bn in India over the next five to seven years.

In April Facebook said it would invest $5.7bn for a 9.99% stake in Jio, making it the cut-price Indian mobile internet provider's largest minority shareholder.

The investment arms of US technology giants Intel and Qualcomm have also bought smaller smaller stakes in the company.

""Shopping spree""

Arunoday Mukharji, BBC News, Delhi

Mr Ambani has been on a shopping spree, managing to hook 11 big investors in the last three months and raising over $20bn.

Not only has it helped him remove his net debt of $21bn, he is now looking to expand in the e-commerce space to rival giants like Amazon in India.

His online venture Jio Mart wants to tap into Facebook-owned Whatsapp's 400 million users in India to connect customers with their nearest mom and pop stores - hugely popular in India.

This is why the $6bn Facebook investment in April becomes even more significant.

Mr Ambani also said his company had developed a fully home-grown 5G network. This is important for two major reasons.

First, it fits the script of Prime Minister Modi's repeated push for a self-reliant India.

Second, and more importantly, it seriously damages prospects of tech giants like China's Huawei, which was looking to participate in India's 5G trials.

In the aftermath of the recent border standoff between India and China, the government has been reconsidering all major business engagements with China.

Jio, which is India's newest major mobile operator, grew rapidly to take the number one spot late last year.

Since launching in September 2016 the low cost service has attracted almost 400m subscribers and aims to increase that figure to 500m in the next three years.

In January Reliance announced that it would launch a grocery delivery service that aimed to compete with Amazon in India.

US technology companies see India as a key market for growth, with the number of internet users there seen rising to more than 850m in 2022, according to consultancy firm PwC.

Mr Ambani, who is the chairman and managing director of Jio's parent company Reliance Industries, is now the world's ninth-richest person, with a net worth of $68.7bn, according to Forbes.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",BBC News,Ambani: Google latest US tech giant to invest in India's Jio,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53426791

"Intel said on Friday it will invest $253.5 million in Jio Platforms, joining a roster of high-profile investors including Facebook, General Atlantic and Silver Lake that have backed India’s top telecom operator in recent months.

The American chipmaker’s investment arm said it is acquiring a 0.39% stake in Jio Platforms, giving the Indian firm a valuation of $65 billion. Intel Capital is the twelfth investor to buy a stake in Jio Platforms, which has raised more than $15.5 billion by selling a 25% stake since April this year.

“Jio Platforms’ focus on applying its impressive engineering capabilities to bring the power of low-cost digital services to India aligns with Intel’s purpose of delivering breakthrough technology that enriches lives. We believe digital access and data can transform business and society for the better,” said Wendell Brooks, Intel Capital president, in a statement.

The announcement today comes weeks after Mukesh Ambani, who controls Reliance Industries — the parent firm of Jio Platforms — suggested that Saudi Arabia’s PIF $1.5 billion investment on June 18 in his digital unit had marked the “end of Jio Platforms’ current phase of induction of financial partners.”

Ambani, who is India’s richest man, said on Friday that he was excited to “work together with Intel to advance India’s capabilities in cutting-edge technologies that will empower all sectors of our economy and improve the quality of life of 1.3 billion Indians.”

The new deal further illustrates the opportunities foreign investors see in Jio, a four-year-old subsidiary of Reliance Industries (India’s most valuable firm) that has upended the telecommunications market in India with cut-rate voice calls and mobile data tariffs. Jio has about 400 million subscribers.

Analysts at Bernstein said last month that they expect Jio Platforms to reach 500 million customers by 2023, and control half of the market by 2025. Jio Platforms competes with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, a joint venture between British giant Vodafone and Indian tycoon Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Aditya Birla Group.

Jio Platforms also operates a bevy of digital apps and services, including music streaming service JioSaavn (which it says it will take public), on-demand live television service JioTV and payments app JioMoney, as well as smartphones and broadband business. These services are available to Jio subscribers at no additional charge.

On Thursday evening, Jio Platforms launched JioMeet, a video-conferencing service that offers unlimited calls with “up to 24 hours” time limit on each session. The service, which currently has no paid plans, looks uncannily like Zoom.

"Intel Capital latest to back India's digital future

06 July 2020 | Melanie Mingas

Intel Capital, the investment arm of Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) has joined the growing list of global firms investing in a stake in India’s digital future.

The American multinational on Friday confirmed it was to invest US$250 million in Jio Platforms, owned by Reliance Industries, for a 0.39% equity stake.

The deal makes Intel Capital the 11th backer since Facebook took a 9.99% stake in late April and the start of a second phase of investment activity.

Wendell Brooks, president of Intel Capital, said: “Jio Platforms’ focus on applying its impressive engineering capabilities to bring the power of low-cost digital services to India aligns with Intel’s purpose of delivering breakthrough technology that enriches lives. We believe digital access and data can transform business and society for the better. Through this investment, we are excited to help fuel digital transformation in India, where Intel maintains an important presence.”

Intel has operated in India for more than two decades and operates state-of-the-art design facilities in Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

Prior to this latest deal, Jio Platforms had raised more than $23 billion in 58 days from investments and a stake sale to BP. The company said the deals, which also included India’s largest ever rights issue, were “unprecedented in Indian corporate history and have set new benchmarks”.

When Jio’s 10th backer – Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – was announced last month, the firm said it marked “the end of Jio Platforms’ current phase of induction of financial partners”, following which it would begin preparations for an IPO by 2024.

Mukesh Ambani, chair and MD of Reliance Industries, said: “We are extremely delighted to deepen our ties with technology leaders that embody our vision of transforming India into a leading digital society in the world.

“Intel is a true industry leader, working towards creating world-changing technology and innovations. Intel Capital has an outstanding record of being a valuable partner for leading technology companies globally. We are therefore excited to work together with Intel to advance India’s capabilities in cutting-edge technologies that will empower all sectors of our economy and improve the quality of life of 1.3 billion Indians.”",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Capacity Media,Intel Capital latest backer for India's digital future,https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825877/intel-capital-latest-to-back-indias-digital-future
"NEW DELHI : A $4.5 billion deal under which Alphabet's Google will collaborate with India's Reliance Industries on a new smartphone likely heralds a big shake-up for the world's second-largest mobile market, industry executives and analysts say.

Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani, announcing the partnership at his company's annual meeting last week, said Google would build an Android operating system (OS) to power a low-cost ""4G or even 5G"" smartphone that Reliance would design.

The new phone is set to pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate a $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India.

Powered by a clever mix of Bollywood, cricket-driven marketing and product features such as powerful cameras, the Chinese firms sell roughly eight of every 10 smartphones in the country.

""If history is anything to go by, Reliance will undercut other brands and pose a real threat to the low-end smartphone market,"" said Rushabh Doshi of tech researcher Canalys.

Reliance executed a similar plan in 2017 with the launch of the JioPhone, a no-frills device that gave users internet access for as little as $20. JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.

""They (the Chinese players) are likely to cut their price to compete and their margins could shrink,"" said A Gururaj, the former India head of contract manufacturers Wistron and Flextronics. ""I see the Google-Jio phone as a big hit.""

Reliance's ambition to hand a smartphone to every Indian could also win subscribers from telecoms rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, who still have hundreds of millions of users with old-style feature phones on basic 2G networks.

Realme declined to comment. Reliance, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo did not respond to requests for comment.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Content is king

The alliance will see Google invest $4.5 billion in Reliance's digital unit, which houses telecoms and fibre businesses as well as music and movie apps.

Jio Platforms has also since April won the backing of global financial and tech investors including Intel and Qualcomm , which could bolster its smartphone ambitions.

While Reliance has given no details on the specifications or price of the new smartphone, the timing of its launch, or who might build it, the Jio network's 387 million subscribers and the Google brand name will give it a big leg up.

The Reliance-Google phone would likely be optimised for the Jio network and offer users improved performance, said Arvind Vohra, a tech consultant and the former India head of China's Gionee.

Just as important are the possibilities for bundling Jio's massive video and music libraries with the phone. Google's Android team also aims to ensure access to apps related to health, communications and jobs, and ease of use for first time smartphone owners, Sameer Samat, vice president for Android and Play at Google, told Reuters.

That kind of packaging could help woo roughly 350 million Indians who still use basic, non-touch phones and are yet to taste high-speed mobile data on fancier devices.

""This will help users choose a device for its software and bundled content rather than just specs alone,"" said Vohra.

The collaboration with Google could also set the stage for further partnerships between smartphone makers and Reliance to make devices specifically for the Jio telecoms network, said analysts.

Some Jio customers are already making plans to upgrade to the Reliance-Google smartphone when it hits the market.

""I'd like to try the new Reliance smartphone and since I'm already a Jio customer my first preference will be to remain with the network,"" said Rawil Ansari, a construction worker from a village in India's eastern Bihar state, who has been using a JioPhone for the past two years.

"As the pandemic challenges just about everything, what is the responsibility it puts on business leaders?

Businesses will need to look at the evolving consumer needs in the post-Covid-19 world and this calls for leaders to revisit their strategy and innovate with agility and resiliency. Organisations will adopt changes arising from these times in the long-term. For one, some percentage of the workforce may remain remote and the rest would also see increased flexibility.

Leading virtual teams and enabling them with the right technology and tools will be the norm. Inclusion will be more important, and leaders should further nurture an empathic and compassionate approach to connecting with and motivating their teams.

From an ecosystem perspective, we need to apply our learnings to refocus and reinvent the way we work together and enable innovation. It has become imperative for organisations to adopt a collaborative approach to solve the world's greatest challenges. This is especially true for technology companies as data and information play a crucial role in transforming key sectors like healthcare, education, manufacturing, retail, transportation and agriculture among others.

Would you agree the pandemic has accelerated existing technologies rather than birthed something unprecedented?

The pandemic has pushed both the development and deployment of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, cloud and automation in key sectors. For example, as part of a multi-disciplinary initiative, Intel India is working with Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad to help achieve faster and less expensive Covid-19 testing and coronavirus genome sequencing to understand epidemiology and AI-based risk stratification for patients with comorbidities.

In another tech ecosystem initiative, a NASSCOM taskforce that I am leading built a technology-driven vision of a Pandemic Response Platform for India - a platform that we architected as an open API-based locally hosted, privacy preserving, multi-cloud infrastructure that enables a multitude of citizen-centric apps. This Pandemic Response Platform is designed to augment the central and state governments' efforts with a robust set of population scale Covid-19 indicators that help predict outbreaks and improve medical care administration. This end-to-end platform was delivered to the governments of Telangana and Karnataka recently. Along with NASSCOM and Intel, the project taskforce for the development and delivery of this platform included participation from NASSCOM members and other companies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Fractal, Infosys, Mapbox, Microsoft, Mindtree, SAP, Sprinklr, and Wipro.

What are some of the changes Intel had to undertake from a business continuity perspective?

The pandemic propelled us overnight into a scenario that had almost our entire workforce working remotely, along with our contingent workers and ecosystem partners. Intel IT had to quickly embrace creative solutions that would enable scaling rapidly.

To pivot our workforce while maintaining business operations, we made changes across design site operations, supply chain, sales and marketing, human resources and finance. We worked closely with the government to safely enable critical and essential work at Intel sites with a smaller number of essential personnel. We had to quickly adapt our formal processes in many areas to accelerate response such as making exceptions to our procurement processes, modifying on-boarding/off-boarding processes allowing employees to be virtual, etc. Our sales and marketing people had to shift to working with our customers and industry partners through virtual engagements and events. To provide a seamless and consistent experience, we had to fine-tune multiple platforms to both enable and accelerate collaboration.

What are some of the predictions of the changes in the Indian business and economy landscape from here, especially in the context of the technological changes?

Business continuity will need increased automation, safe manufacturing, and social distancing - all of which will require transformational technology to execute. Customer experiences will have to be re-imagined for a contactless environment. The proliferation of internet and cloud will continue to be the most efficient service delivery model across different sectors.

For example, in the healthcare space, telemedicine will gain prominence while technology will also play a role in predicting and managing outbreaks using population-scale data and analytics.

In retail, social distancing practices will drive innovation in both e-commerce and brick and mortar stores, increasing the use of augmented reality, virtual reality, computer vision and internet of things (IoT) technologies.

In education, the pandemic has highlighted the need for access to computers and the internet. The e-learning ecosystem will become mainstream and empower the masses with access to quality content and instructors.

The need of the hour is to collaborate with the ecosystem and work together to develop solutions to unleash the potential of data-driven technology and transform business and society for the better. Intel is fortunate to be deeply engaged with these ecosystems in providing the tools and services that people around the world depend upon in their daily lives ­- and in putting technology to work towards understanding and fighting this virus.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",BW Businessworld,"Digital Readiness No Longer Optional: Nivruti Rai, Country Head, Intel India & VP, Data Platforms Group, Intel Corporation",http://www.businessworld.in/article/Digital-Readiness-No-Longer-Optional-Nivruti-Rai-Country-Head-Intel-India-VP-Data-Platforms-Group-Intel-Corporation/03-07-2020-293698
"India is emerging as a key hub for public cloud-based services in Asia. India’s public cloud market is dominated by three webscale players: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure , and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Boston Consulting Group (BCG) values this market around USD$3 billion in 2020, and estimates the market to grow by 25% CAGR to USD$8 billion by 2023. In our perspective, India’s public cloud infrastructure includes regional data centres owned by webscale players, as well as more than 100 others distributed across the country, that are either network-neutral data centres or owned by telecom service providers.Traditionally, webscale players have been dominating the public cloud service offerings in system infrastructure services (i.e. IaaS, including compute instances, storage databases, etc.), application infrastructure services (i.e. PaaS, including containers, artificial intelligence, and machine learning , etc.) and software services (i.e. SaaS for various applications). Now webscale players are expanding IaaS services coverage on networking solutions for enterprises (i.e. cloud VPN, accelerators, cloud SD-WAN, IoT, private LTE/5G, and multi-vendor network orchestration).Webscale players’ forays into such networking and telco solutions are mainly driven by the promise of 5G. When I speak to customers and others in the industry , it is widely believed that the next battleground for webscale players is 5G. For example, Microsoft recently made their intentions clear with their acquisitions of Affirmed (vEPC, 5gc) and Metaswitch (vIMS). Google Cloud Platform announced their three-pronged telco strategy that focuses on monetising 5G edge computing solutions, reimagining the customer journey with data and AI, and subsequently helping operators improve internal operations efficiencies. Google Cloud Platform is also extending their Anthos hybrid multi-could platform to support telecom operators Telecom operators in India have also started their own ‘telco cloud’ journey. Although these efforts initially were started to support their own internal network function virtualisation (NFV) initiatives, these operators now see a big opportunity to play a critical role in the delivery of cloud services in India as well.As digital services for various vertical markets expand with applications where latency becomes critical for cloud computing services, it is only logical to also bring compute closer to where the data is generated. Hence we’re seeing a surge in interest for edge computing across the world, including in India. India’s leading ‘edge use cases’ are likely to be media processing, telemedicine, video surveillance, manufacturing, and a myriad of immersive applications such as AR/VR and gaming.All three leading webscale players have launched their edge solutions – Azure Stack; AWS Outpost, Wavelength, Local Zone; Google Anthos – which cover on-premises colocations with telecom operators and private zones. It is expected that many of these edge offerings could be commercially launched soon in India in partnerships with telecom operators.Telecom operators are expected to enter into strategic partnerships with multiple webscale players. For these operators to deliver the low-latency services promised by 5G and edge computing, close partnerships with the webscale players will be needed, so they can monetise ‘connectivity’ as a platform to broaden and enhance their competitive advantage.Despite massive capital investments in 3G and 4G, pressures on average revenue per user have resulted in no meaningful profitability returns to date. 3G and 4G deployments in India have instead been more about capturing and holding onto market share to later monetise. Fortunately, 5G promises to deliver more than just higher speed connectivity. This is pushing telecom operators towards reinvigorating a ‘platform economy’ for the business ecosystem, to better monetise their investments. Bundling of services has not proven profitable during 3G and 4G eras, so rather than pursuing that as a strategy, you will see telecom service providers offering differentiated 5G services priced at different levels.According to Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2019 by Stanford University, insatiable demands from both consumer and business sectors are doubling “compute” requirements in less than every 4 months. Therefore, compute processing and storage capacity can no longer keep up with Moore’s Law. Amidst this growth, ‘Connect Networks’ are expected to play a more critical role than ever before to efficiently use compute processing resources. For example, tightly coupled distributed computing across a set of edge data centers in the metro network, with well-engineered connectivity, has the promise to deliver ‘fungible pools of distributed cloud computing’ to meet webscale players’ edge cloud service capacity and performance metrics. This is good news for telecom operators, who can now enable the right type of connectivity for edge cloud service needs.Telecom operators have a great opportunity to put their strengths to work by monetizing quality of experience in ‘connect platforms’ by way of Network Slicing, coupled with new consumption and charging models.While the concept behind network slicing is not new, it is to be understood as the ability to custom fit network connectivity to application needs over a common shared network. Recent technical advancements – specifically the advent of Segment Routing (SR), cloud-based controllers and open platforms with APIs for webscale players and application providers to collaborate in a business ecosystem – have made mass implementations of network slicing possible. For example, currently, a service provider might approach monetization as a single connectivity model simply based on speed, up-time, or both. In the future, this same service provider could enable a matrix of API driven platform slices to meet a few different application requirements and target quality of experience. The set of monetization options could be, as example, four slices and with on-demand or schedulable time windows.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",ETTelecom.com,‘Platform economy’: Indian telecom operators opportunity to monetize the cloud business,https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/platform-economy-indian-telecom-operators-opportunity-to-monetize-the-cloud-business/77062407
"NEW DELHI: Apple Inc assembly partner Pegatron Corp is making preparations for its first plant in India, adding to a large influx of foreign tech investments in the country this year.In June, the Indian government set out a $6.6 billion plan to woo the world’s top smartphone manufacturers, offering financial incentives and ready-to-use manufacturing clusters. Pegatron is now setting up a local subsidiary and joining fellow Taiwanese electronics assemblers Foxconn Technology Group and Wistron Corp, who have already been making some iPhone handsets in southern India.With a number of factories in China, Pegatron is the second-largest iPhone assembler and depends on Apple for more than half of its business. Like its peers, it will set up in the south of India, according to a person familiar with its plans who asked not to be named. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, and Wistron are looking to expand their operations in the country, and Pegatron’s entry can be seen as a defensive move to protect its share of budget iPhone manufacturing, according to Matthew Kanterman of Bloomberg Intelligence.Pegatron could uphold its iPhone SE assembly market share, which may have grown from a 50-50 split with Hon Hai: Matthew Kanterman, analystIndia has seen a surge of inward investment in recent weeks, with Google, Facebook Inc and others pouring close to $20 billion into Jio Platforms Ltd, billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s mobile internet venture. Google has committed to spending $10 billion over the next five to seven years to hasten India’s digital transition and Amazon.com Inc has said it intends to export $10 billion of made-in-India goods by 2025. When Jeff Bezos visited the country in January, he said, “The 21st century is going to be the Indian century.”The country offers a vast pool of skilled labor as well as a domestic market of a billion mobile connections. Only about half of those are smartphones, however, leaving untapped potential that is attractive to growth-hungry global brands like Apple, Samsung Electronics Co, Xiaomi Corp and Oppo. For assemblers like Pegatron, exports would also be an enticing opportunity, especially at a time of worsening trade relations between Washington and Beijing making it imperative to have a diverse geographic base.Smartphones are a focal point for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s much-touted Make in India program. Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s minister for information technology and electronics, has said the goal is for brands and manufacturers to transport the entire supply chain to the country, not just the end-stage assembly. Quoted by local media, Prasad said India wants not only the “bridegroom” but also the “wedding procession.”India will become a global manufacturing hub for both components and the complete assembly of smartphones and other devices , said Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the Indian Cellular & Electronics Association. The group’s three dozen members include Apple, Foxconn, Google, Wistron, Oppo and others.“The focus is shifting from making for India to exports and the $400 billion electronics manufacturing that India is targeting by 2025 will be dominated by exports,” Mohindroo said via phone from New Delhi.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",ETTelecom.com,Apple iPhone assembler joins wave of tech investment in India,https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/apple-iphone-assembler-joins-wave-of-tech-investment-in-india/77029384

"New Delhi, A new MalSpam, or malicious spam campaign is now targeting manufacturing and export sectors in India, Seqrite, the enterprise arm of Pune-based IT security firm Quick Heal Technologies, warned on Monday.The attackers generally use publicly available file hosting services such as Pastebin and Bitly to host their payloads to hide behind legitimate services that remain undetected, said researchers at Seqrite.The attack begins in the form of a phishing email sent to a genuine user.This contains MS Office PowerPoint files with a malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro.Cybercriminals use VBA programming in Microsoft Office macros as a medium to spread viruses, worms, and other forms of malware on a computer system Post execution, the malware takes advantage of pre-existing legitimate software to download malicious payload from Pastebin and continues to spread the infection.According to Seqrite, some of the common Remote-Access-Tools used by attackers are Agent Tesla, Remcos RAT and NanoCore RAT.Following the tracks of these campaigns since April, the researchers have found that attackers do not restrict themselves to a single geography or vertical.They also noticed that similar campaigns existed earlier as well that targeted varied organisations including those managed by the government.The timely detection and blocking of such attack campaigns is essential for maintaining the integrity and trust in the businesses.Seqrite recommended users to exercise ample caution and avoid opening attachments and clicking on web links in unsolicited emails.Businesses should consider disabling macros, keep their Operating Systems updated and have a full-fledged security solution installed on all the devices, the company said.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",ETTelecom.com,"Malicious spam targeting India's manufacturing, export detected",https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/malicious-spam-targeting-indias-manufacturing-export-detected/77077175
"By Sankalp PhartiyalNEW DELHI: A $4.5 billion deal under which Alphabet's Google will collaborate with India's Reliance Industries on a new smartphone likely heralds a big shake-up for the world's second-largest mobile market, industry executives and analysts say.Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani, announcing the partnership at his company's annual meeting last week, said Google would build an Android operating system (OS) to power a low-cost ""4G or even 5G"" smartphone that Reliance would design.The new phone is set to pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate a $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India.Powered by a clever mix of Bollywood, cricket-driven marketing and product features such as powerful cameras, the Chinese firms sell roughly eight of every 10 smartphones in the country.""If history is anything to go by, Reliance will undercut other brands and pose a real threat to the low-end smartphone market,"" said Rushabh Doshi of tech researcher Canalys.Reliance executed a similar plan in 2017 with the launch of the JioPhone, a no-frills device that gave users internet access for as little as $20. JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.""They (the Chinese players) are likely to cut their price to compete and their margins could shrink,"" said A Gururaj, the former India head of contract manufacturers Wistron and Flextronics. ""I see the Google-Jio phone as a big hit.""Reliance's ambition to hand a smartphone to every Indian could also win subscribers from telecoms rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel , who still have hundreds of millions of users with old-style feature phones on basic 2G networks.Realme declined to comment. Reliance, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo did not respond to requests for comment.Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.CONTENT IS KINGThe alliance will see Google invest $4.5 billion in Reliance's digital unit, which houses telecoms and fibre businesses as well as music and movie apps.Jio Platforms has also since April won the backing of global financial and tech investors including Intel and Qualcomm , which could bolster its smartphone ambitions.While Reliance has given no details on the specifications or price of the new smartphone, the timing of its launch, or who might build it, the Jio network's 387 million subscribers and the Google brand name will give it a big leg up.The Reliance-Google phone would likely be optimised for the Jio network and offer users improved performance, said Arvind Vohra, a tech consultant and the former India head of China's Gionee.Just as important are the possibilities for bundling Jio's massive video and music libraries with the phone. Google's Android team also aims to ensure access to apps related to health, communications and jobs, and ease of use for first time smartphone owners, Sameer Samat, vice president for Android and Play at Google, told Reuters.That kind of packaging could help woo roughly 350 million Indians who still use basic, non-touch phones and are yet to taste high-speed mobile data on fancier devices ""This will help users choose a device for its software and bundled content rather than just specs alone,"" said Vohra.The collaboration with Google could also set the stage for further partnerships between smartphone makers and Reliance to make devices specifically for the Jio telecoms network, said analysts.Some Jio customers are already making plans to upgrade to the Reliance-Google smartphone when it hits the market.""I'd like to try the new Reliance smartphone and since I'm already a Jio customer my first preference will be to remain with the network,"" said Rawil Ansari, a construction worker from a village in India's eastern Bihar state, who has been using a JioPhone for the past two years.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",ETTelecom.com,Reliance-Google smartphone deal in India threatens Chinese firms,https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/reliance-google-smartphone-deal-in-india-threatens-chinese-firms/77067748
"Experts say that we shouldn’t go with a single vendor; risks go down with multiple vendors.

New Delhi: The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has banned 59 mobile apps, including China’s TikTok, SHAREiT and WeChat on grounds of security. Its official statement said that it received multiple complaints from various sources about the misuse of some smartphone apps available on Android and iOS platforms for “stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India. The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures.”

On the following Thursday, the Cyber Cell of the Ministry of Defence issued a cyber-security advisory to its personnel on these 59 apps. It asked for these apps to be removed from their phones by them and their family members. This is relevant as in 2016 a water-hole (luring to a topic of interest, in this case a defence news website), was an attack on defence personnel by two leading cyber-security firms—Trend Micro and Proof Point.

In a report dated 18 June in the Indian Express (IE), sources said that signalling behemoth China Railway Signal and Communication (CRSC) Corp is set to lose a Rs 500 crore contract with Indian Railways. It added that according to other sources, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has asked state-owned BSNL not to use Chinese-made equipment in its upgradation. Additionally, DoT was “actively considering” telling private mobile service providers to “reduce their dependence on China-made equipment. In the current situation, the safety and security of networks built with Chinese equipment will be under scrutiny. The ownership patterns of Huawei and ZTE could become a sticking point in India’s network upgradation (to 5G and 4G) plans.”

Group Captain (Retd) Ajey Lele, head of the Centre on Strategic Technologies at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) says that it might not stop with apps. “India might no longer look at 5G from a technological or cost advantage perspective but purely from a strategic one,” he feels. “Not just now when the border is live but Chinese activities have always been seen with suspicion, whether it is cyberattacks or investments into Indian tech companies.” His view on 5G was shared by a few other experts who wished not to be named.

Munish Sharma, consultant at the Strategic Technologies Centre at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), on being asked if China was stealing data, said that if we looked at history, in December 2017, the MoD issued a notification about 40-42 apps including UC Browser, SHAREit, WeChat and some Mi apps. Most of these were Chinese apps and among the non-Chinese apps there was TrueCaller. Due to the sensitive nature of their duty, defence personnel were told to remove these from their smartphones. Since 2017, security issues from these apps have been acknowledged. He added that there was also data sensitivity pretext and data mining issues.

Dr Lele said that cyberattacks were already happening (limited scale, low intensity) for some time now, but in the cyber domain there was the issue of “attribution”—proving who carried out the cyberattack. All such attacks are covert attacks. China is anyway unlikely to use cyber warfare as an acknowledged state policy.

INDIA’S LEVERAGE WITH THE 5G CARROT

India, as the second largest country by population and with more than 420 million cell phone users, would affect how the 5G war turns out for the US and its allies on the one hand and China on the other. It should be factored in that some in India may have sought to curry favours with China in return for allowing Huawei into the country. But that seems unlikely now. India-China relations took a turn for the better after Wuhan, which led to tangible actions being taken like not blocking the testing of Chinese telecommunication equipment. Now India can use the same leverage to make China correct its course. The US warning about Chinese 5G equipment is one thing, but India doing the same is another. Not only would China lose out on the huge Indian market, the move would give the US an influential ally in its fight against China on 5G. Additionally, Indian action would trigger a chain reaction among various countries especially in the South East Asian region and NAM members. Can China afford that?

WHAT IS 5G?

The fifth generation or 5G telecommunication networks are among the most talked about topics today. Network providers promise consumers seamless coverage, high speed data, low latency (delay in initiation of data transfer) and highly reliable communications with 5G networks. On the other hand, it is essential for Internet of Things (IoT), where multiple devices, like smart refrigerators, smart cars, etc., can communicate with each other and designated phones and computers. Such communication is the building block for the smart cities project. It would also help with tasks such as providing tele-surgery in smaller towns or remote rural areas. Recently in the NATO alliance a topic hotly discussed is also if Huawei should be allowed to supply equipment for its 5G networks.

OPTIONS FOR INDIA

India has two simple options—to ban Chinese 5G equipment altogether or ban it from the core parts of the telecommunication network initially. How does this affect us in the technological and economic domain? Read on. The government might face resistance from the industry, but as Dr Lele points out, we must swallow the bitter pill. Munish Sharma too points out a way (discussed later) to mitigate these issues.

A senior expert says on the condition of anonymity that Huawei holds most of the 5G patents and also offers end to end solutions. CISCO and Ericsson only supply bits and pieces of the hardware. Huawei, in certain areas, also runs the telecommunication network for our telcos. When asked in the absence of skilled personnel to do it, Chinese vendors not only provided equipment for 4G in India but their banks also provided loans to telecom companies. As such, from the perspective of profit, Indian telecom companies prefer Huawei.

A suggestion is that we should allow Huawei components in our 5G network but also regulate it as UK. It doesn’t allow Huawei components into the core areas of its network but only allows it in its peripheral areas. “Data is the new oil—with 5G, data from cars, refrigerators, IoT devices could be visible to Huawei,” the expert adds. But now UK has banned Huawei altogether from its 5G network.

Group Captain (Retd) Dr Ajey Lele, head of the Centre on Strategic Technologies at IDSA, says that we will have to weigh our options. Huawei is offering 5G technologies at a cheaper rate, many of the patents are held by Huawei. But there is also the larger motive of using tech for other purposes. Backers of the company say it is too early to pass a judgement. Huawei doesn’t have a good reputation as per US reports on them. US fears of cyber espionage are well founded. As such, total control of the network by Huawei is harmful.

Sharma adds that it is the call of the government whether or not to ban Huawei from the 5G network on reasons of security. On grounds of security, Australia and US stopped buying equipment from Huawei. But UK and Germany saw it from a broader perspective and didn’t play along.

SECURITY ASSURANCES

Munish Sharma says that this in fact started much before 5G was planned. Since 2012 itself, US has been trying to ban Huawei. In 2018, it barred Huawei from government contracts. We need to review the security issues thoroughly. The US has reviewed it and banned Huawei but we haven’t done it yet. We need to conduct an independent review for final deployment. UK has undertaken such a review and banned Huawei. Germany too is doing one such review. Experts say that we shouldn’t go with a single vendor; risks go down with multiple vendors.

Sharma adds that Huawei is around 30% cheaper than its competitors—Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung. Huawei’s turnaround time again is quicker. Speaking internationally, Huawei goes to far-off and non-lucrative markets like Africa, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. It is hence a cheaper and better alternative for telecom companies in poor countries

There is one way to ban Huawei, ZTE and still not face resistance from the telecom industry. Munish Sharma says that the equipment cost is fixed. But the government can cut spectrum costs and the benefits could be passed on to the consumer. 5G spectrum is many times cheaper in South Korea. US has made 5G spectrum free for a 10-year trial-run period. We should decide accordingly. This would place this essential industry on a marginally higher cost of equipment, and when deprived of soft loans Chinese banks provide to buy equipment from Huawei and ZTE.

It is time that India used all its options to push back border aggression by China. We can recalibrate only when China shows significant changes in its behaviour and withdraws from all its encroachments, but even then we mustn’t be complacent. Trust but verify as they say and keep strong cards not just close to our heart but use them to our advantage.

"Google has become the latest high-profile firm to back India’s Reliance Jio Platforms. The search giant is investing $4.5 billion for a 7.73% stake in the top Indian telecom network, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Wednesday.

The investment today from Google is one of the rare instances when the Android-maker has joined its global rival Facebook in backing a firm. Facebook invested $5.7 billion in Reliance Jio Platforms, which has amassed more than 400 million subscribers in less than four years of its existence, in April this year for a 9.99% stake in it. Facebook is the largest minority stakeholder in Jio Platforms.

Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries (India’s most valued firm) has raised about $20.2 billion in the past four months from 13 investors by selling about 33% stake in the firm. (For some context, the entire Indian startup ecosystem raised $14.5 billion last year.)

Google’s new investment gives Jio Platforms an equity valuation of $58 billion — the same valuation implied by Facebook. Other investors, including General Atlantic, Silver Lake, Qualcomm, Intel and Vista, have paid a 12.5% premium for their stake in Jio Platforms.

As part of Wednesday’s strategic announcement, Google and Reliance Jio Platforms will work on a customized-version of Android operating system to develop low-cost, entry-level smartphones to serve the next hundreds of millions of users, said Ambani. These phones will support Google Play and future wireless standard 5G, he said.

“Getting technology into the hands of more people is a big part of Google’s mission,” said Sundar Pichai, chief executive at Google, via a video chat on Wednesday. “Together we are excited to rethink, from the ground up, how millions of users in India can become owners of smartphones. This effort will unlock new opportunities, further power the vibrant ecosystem of applications and push innovation to drive growth for the new Indian economy,” he said.

The new deal further illustrates the opportunities foreign investors see in Jio Platforms that has upended the telecommunications market in India with cut-rate voice calls and mobile data tariffs. This is not the first time Jio Platforms has expressed interest in mobile operating system or handsets. The company has shipped at least 40 million JioPhone powered by KaiOS. These “smart feature” phones support a handful of apps, including Facebook’s WhatsApp. Google is an investor in KaiOS’ eponymous developer.

Have been hearing the ""Can India produce a Google?"" question for the last ten years. Looking forward to the ""Can the US produce a Jio?"" question for the next ten years. — Sumanth Raghavendra (@sumanthr) July 15, 2020

Analysts at Bernstein said last month that they expect Jio Platforms — which competes with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, a joint venture between British giant Vodafone and Indian tycoon Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Aditya Birla Group, in India — to reach 500 million customers by 2023, and control half of the market by 2025.

Google, which like Facebook reaches nearly every online user in India, announced a new fund on Monday through which it said it plans to invest $10 billion in Asia’s third largest economy over the next five to seven years. Its investment in Jio Platforms today is the first investment from the Google For India Digitization Fund.

Jio Platforms also operates a range of digital services, including a music streaming player and a video conferencing app. On Wednesday, Jio Platforms unveiled its newest offering: the Jio Glass.

Jio Platforms executives said Jio Glass wearers will be able to perform video calls and access more than two dozen apps. They did not disclose when Jio Platforms plans to make this new gadget available to consumers and what it would cost. Jio Platforms has unveiled devices in the past that sometimes take years to reach consumers — and sometimes they are quietly abandoned. Jio unveiled a similar pair of spectacles last year.

Some investors have told TechCrunch in recent months that Reliance Jio Platforms’ owner — India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani — and his closeness to the ruling political party in India are also crucial to why the digital unit of Reliance Industries is so attractive to many.

They believe that buying a stake in Jio Platforms would lower the regulatory burden they — and their portfolio firms — currently face in India. The investors requested anonymity as they did not wish to talk about the political tie-ups publicly.

A person familiar with the matter at one of the 13 firms that has backed Reliance Jio Platforms said that the Indian firm is also enticing as globally companies are trying to cut down their reliance and exposure on China.

India, and the U.S., in recent months have taken actions to limit their reliance on Chinese firms. New Delhi last month banned 59 apps and services including TikTok that are developed by Chinese firms. Reliance Jio Platforms has interestingly yet to raise capital from any Chinese investor.

“Jio, for its part, has made an extraordinary contribution to India’s technological progress over the past decade. Its investments to expand telecommunications infrastructure, low-cost phones and affordable internet have changed the way its hundreds of millions of subscribers find news and information, communicate with one another, use services and run businesses. Today, Jio is increasing its focus on the development of areas like digital services, education, healthcare and entertainment that can support economic growth and social inclusion at a critical time in the country’s history,” said Pichai.

Reliance Industries, whose core businesses are in petrochemicals, has said in recent months that it plans to list Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail, another subsidiary of the firm, within five years. It’s a big week for firms in India. On Tuesday, Walmart led a $1.2 billion financing round in Flipkart to increase its majority stake in the 13-year-old Indian e-commerce firm.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",TechCrunch,Google invests $4.5 billion in India’s Reliance Jio Platforms,https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/

The evolution from 0G to 5G has been a trajectory of technology as much as of applications and consumer empowerment. Based on a timeline provided by Firooz B. Saghezchi et al.,[2] the technology of telecommunications has generally advanced every four to 14 years: seven years from 1G to 2G, five years from 2G to 2.5G, four years from 2.5G to 3G and 14 years from 3G to 4G. It is estimated that the shift from 4G to 5G should take approximately eight years, and 5G will be ubiquitous across the world by 2021. The shift from 4G to 5G is not merely about the speed of downloads, though speed is an essential component of what it can deliver. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU),[3] the framework for the development of the International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT) 2020 standards takes 5G into account, with a spectrum efficiency that is expected to be three times higher (with very low over-the-air latency) and will support high-speed trains or Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) scenarios,[4] characterised by a large number of connected devices transmitting relatively low volume of non-delay sensitive data, useful to cover IoT, smart agriculture, smart cities, energy monitoring, smart home and remote monitoring.[5]

However, it is what 5G enables that makes the technology as lethal to its users as it is beneficial. In the near future, 5G is set to become the backbone of smart cities and IoT. Through enhanced mobile broadband, the technology can deliver augmented- and virtual-reality functionality. It can enable climate-smart agriculture, smart cities and smart homes through MMTC. It can drive autonomous vehicles, smart grids, remote patient monitoring and telehealth, and industrial automation through ultra-reliable and low-latency communications,[6] all of which depend on the ability of 5G technology to support, link and power the IoT. The IoT has been defined by D. Minoli and B. Occhiogrosso:[7]

“The basic concept of IoT is to enable objects of all kinds to have sensing, actuating, and communication capabilities, so that locally-intrinsic or extrinsic data can be collected, processed, transmitted, concentrated, and analysed for either cyber-physical goals at the collection point (or perhaps along the way), or for process/environment/systems analytics (of predictive or historical nature) at a processing centre, often ‘on the cloud’. Applications range from infrastructure and critical-infrastructure support (for example smart grid, smart city, smart building, and transportation), to end-user applications such as e-health, crowdsensing, and further along, to a multitude of other applications where only the imagination is the limit. Some refer to the field as ‘connected technology’. While the reach of IoT is (expected to be, or become) all-encompassing, a more well-established subset deals with Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, where some architectural constructs and specific Use Cases have already been defined by the standardisation community.”

According to Saghezchi et al., 5G technology is still evolving:[8]

“5G is still to be defined officially by standardisation bodies. It will be a system of super high‐capacity and ultra‐high‐speed data with new design requirements tailored towards energy elicited systems and reduced operational expenditure for operators. In this context, 5G envisages not only one invented technology, but a technology ecosystem of wireless networks working in synergy to provide a seamless communication medium to the end user. Thus, we can say that moving from 4G to 5G means a shift in design paradigm from a single‐discipline system to a multi‐discipline system.”

What is this ecosystem? The complexity of 5G technology is such that it needs highly specialised world-class expertise and equipment for its various components. Huawei, for example, procures only some components from its home country, China. These include cameras, laser amplifiers and batteries. It sources antennas, data storage, modems, software and licences from the US; semi-conductors from Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland or Taiwan; and memory cards and display panels from Japan. Since the US placed a ban on doing business with Huawei, the company has had to look elsewhere to source several essential components.[9]

Of significance here is the fact that the intricacy of 5G technology requires equipment providers to source components from a variety of countries and companies (as Huawei does), and these sources include Chinese manufacturers. Thus, even if India were to ban Huawei or Chinese firms for 5G, some Chinese components may still find their way into the Indian market through other vendors. For example, radar sensors are an important component for remote medical diagnosis and surgery, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication for self-driving cars, smart transportation and smart industry. This is a market that Huawei is attempting to enter,[10] and its ecosystem comprises chip designers, component manufacturers, technology providers and system integrators. Companies that make them are spread across Germany, Japan, UK, Netherlands, the US and Sweden. The job of radar-sensor manufacturers, therefore, involves getting the best components from across the world and assembling them. The question that arises then is this: What will be the effective ‘country of origin’ of such a product that, like an Apple iPhone, may have components from companies from all over the world? Conversely, what is the guarantee that 5G equipment from Sweden’s Ericsson, South Korea’s Samsung, Finland’s Nokia or the US’ Cisco will not carry components from China’s Huawei or ZTE? One way forward is to simply rely on the fact that the final assembling, and thus the control and accountability, will be in the hands of a non-Chinese firm and therefore subjected to democratic scrutiny and justice, not to the whims of an authoritarian China.

As a critical telecommunications infrastructure that is global, 5G can deliver a boundless, high-speed, reliable and secure broadband experience; create innovative future networks; provide the networks and platforms to drive the digitisation and automation of industrial practices and processes (including the 4IR); and power the IoT and critical communications services.[11] It can also bring societal changes—individual, corporate, regulatory and governmental. 5G will be to the 21st century what computers and satellites were to the 20th century and steam engines to the 19th century. Through IoT, this technology is expected to fundamentally transform the role that telecommunications plays in our lives, not only delivering a future where all people are connected to one another, but also creating a society where everything and everyone is connected.[12]

While the benefits of 5G are unimaginable, those driving the technology can also wreak havoc that on governments, citizens, financial flows and businesses, at a scale unprecedented and through an intrusion unmatched. In light of this, to hand this infrastructure to a foreign company (Huawei) that is bound by law (See Section 3) to support its nation of origin (China) on matters of intelligence-gathering is to expose India to tremendous risk.

Imagine the potential destruction if self-driven cars are sent distorted signals, long-distance operations sent incorrect images, traffic lights in smart cities manipulated to create accidents, communications infrastructure for airlines or railways disrupted, business secrets of rival firms culled out, fake news narratives created. Above all, imagine the possibility of injecting spyware into the security infrastructure or into financial systems of stock, currency or commodity exchanges, all of which would be acts of war. In repeated tensions along borders or in support of Pakistan’s terror, any or all of these would be tools in the hand of the Chinese government to destabilise India and its national interests.

No government, no political party, no regulatory structure and no security system the world over can accept this level of risk for its citizens. Preventing the entry of Huawei can be visualised as a technological policy vaccination.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",MediaNama.com,Protecting 5G and IoT from foreign state interference,https://www.medianama.com/2020/07/223-5g-iot-india-huawei/

"It has an opportunity, with the expansion of G7, to be a part of both the global south and global west

Earlier this year, United States (US) President Donald Trump used his prerogative as G-7 host to suggest inviting the leaders of India, Australia, and South Korea to the annual conclave. “I don’t feel that as a G-7 it properly represents what’s going on in the world. It’s a very outdated group of countries,” Trump said in May. While he later considered adding Brazil, Trump’s proposal was overshadowed by his suggestion that Russia be included, a move opposed by many of his advisers. Meanwhile, questions persist about whether this year’s G-7 summit — already postponed — will be held at all in person amid the coronavirus pandemic.

This is not the first hint that the G-7 format will expand. Last year, France extended a similar invitation to India (along with Australia, Spain, Chile, and five African countries) when it was the host. More recently, the British government floated the prospect of a D-10 partnership of democracies (comprising the G-7-plus India, Australia, and South Korea) to cooperate on 5G telecommunications technology.

These proposals come at a time when cooperation among democracies appears to be back in vogue, amid growing concerns about China’s assertiveness, the global economic battering at the hands of Covid-19, and greater technological competition. Two new mechanisms for coordinating policies related to the pandemic reflect a similar sentiment. The first, consisting of the US, India, Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, and Vietnam (as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), involves the countries’ foreign secretaries or their equivalents. Another initiated by the US secretary of state consists of discussions with his counterparts from Japan, India, Australia, Brazil, South Korea and Israel.

While these have, so far, been one-off initiatives or issue-specific mechanisms, permanently expanding G-7 could represent a logical and natural progression. The G-7 evolved as an annual summit between heads of government after the economic shocks of the early 1970s. It was initially intended to be an informal forum for economic and political coordination involving the largest democratic economies. Starting with the five leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom (UK), it soon expanded to seven with the additions of Italy and Canada. Additionally, the leadership of the European Union (EU) was also included by convention.

The G-7 evolved as an annual summit between heads of government after the economic shocks of the early 1970s.

In the 1990s, as part of a bid to incorporate Russia into a post-Cold War order, G-7 evolved into G-8. For a while, in the early 2000s, a G8+5 format attempted to engage the leaders of the largest developing economies, including China, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico, before the elevation of G-20 after the 2008 global financial crisis made this redundant. In 2014, Russia was dropped after its annexation of Crimea and G-8 reverted to G-7.

The recent signals from Washington, Paris, and London suggest an opportunity to permanently amend G-7 in a manner that better reflects today’s international order and priorities. In 1980, the economies of India, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea ranked 14th, 16th, 17th, and 29th in the world, respectively. Prior to the 2020 pandemic, they were 5th, 14th, 9th, and 12th. Given their relative strengths — large populations, important geographies, technological advantages, and capable militaries — not to mention their systems of governance, the inclusion of some of these countries would undoubtedly strengthen the democratic world’s ability to address today’s most pressing global challenges.

Despite the US’s invitation this year, an expanded G-7 is by no means a foregone conclusion. For now, US entreaties and India’s openness to participating in such formats are driven by tactical considerations, including both countries’ immediate problems with China. A more permanent shift would depend upon whether future leaders perceive value. While the presumptive Democratic nominee for US president Joe Biden has stressed the need to renew multilateral coalitions, he may be reluctant to so obviously exclude China, the world’s second-largest economy.

Despite the US’s invitation this year, an expanded G-7 is by no means a foregone conclusion. For now, US entreaties and India’s openness to participating in such formats are driven by tactical considerations, including both countries’ immediate problems with China

For its part, India has an unusual opportunity. Over the next two years, it will have a leadership role at three important organisations: Chair of the executive board of the World Health Organization (WHO), non-permanent membership on the United National Security Council (UNSC), and chair of G-20. This affords a good opportunity to achieve favourable multilateral outcomes at these and other bodies.

And, yet, India confronts other challenges. One is learning how to effectively utilise such a forum. Indian officials have become so accustomed to working within the framework of the G-77 — the large bloc of developing countries at the United Nations — that working with the G-7 will require a very different mindset. In fact, India could be a natural bridge between the two international groupings, one of which represents the global South, the other the global West.

In fact, India could be a natural bridge between the two international groupings, one of which represents the global South, the other the global West

Finally, there will be the inevitable concerns about whether India’s entry into any such grouping would undermine its strategic autonomy. In fact, it does quite the opposite. India is already a member of groupings such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), East Asia Summit (EAS), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and G-20, all of which meet regularly at the leadership level. Associating with other major economies, all of them democracies, ought to be a worthy aspiration.

India

pti-Madhuri Adnal

New Delhi, July 20: This is a great time to invest in India and the country is welcoming investments in the tech sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told IBM CEO Arvind Krishna on Monday.

In a virtual interaction with Krishna, the prime minister noted that while the world is witnessing a slowdown, FDI inflow in India is increasing. Modi said the country is moving forward with the vision of a self-sufficient India so that a globally competent and disruption resilient local supply chain can be developed, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office.

Talking about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business culture, the prime minister said 'work from home' is being adopted in a big way and the government is constantly working towards providing infrastructure, connectivity and regulatory environment to ensure that this technological shift is smooth.

Modi also discussed the technologies associated and challenges involved in the recent decision of IBM to make 75 per cent of its employees to work from home, the statement said.

The IBM CEO briefed the prime minister about his company's huge investment plans in India and expressed confidence in the vision of an 'Aatma nirbhar Bharat' (a self-reliant India), the statement said.

""The prime minister highlighted that this is a great time to invest in India. He said the country is welcoming and supporting investments taking place in the tech sector. He noted that while the world is witnessing slowdown, FDI inflow in India is increasing,"" the statement said.

In the course of interaction, Modi explored the possibilities of creating India-specific artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools in the healthcare sector and development of better models for disease prediction and analysis. He underlined that the country is moving towards developing an integrated, tech and data-driven healthcare system which is affordable and hassle-free for the people.

Modi noted that IBM can play an important role in taking forward the healthcare vision. Krishna appreciated the prime minister's vision for Ayushman Bharat (the all-India healthcare scheme) and talked about using technology for early identification of diseases. Modi appreciated the role played by IBM, in association with CBSE, towards launching of AI curriculum in 200 schools in India. He said the government is working towards introducing students to concepts such as AI and machine learning at an early stage, to further the tech temperament in the country. Krishna said teaching about technology and data should be in the category of basic skills like algebra, which needs to be taught with passion, and should be introduced early.

Other areas of discussion included the issues of data security, cyber attacks, concerns around privacy and health benefits of yoga. Modi also congratulated Krishna on becoming the global head of IBM earlier this year. He mentioned the strong connection of IBM with India and its huge presence in the country, with over one lakh people working across 20 cities in the company.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Oneindia,Great time to invest in India: PM Modi tells IBM CEO,https://www.oneindia.com/india/great-time-to-invest-in-india-pm-modi-tells-ibm-ceo-3122452.html
"DINESH MALKANI, Founder, Smarten Spaces

One of the biggest challenges for companies during this pandemic is to ensure a safe work environment for employees. In an extended period of uncertainty, to reopen workplaces is to reinvent the business. Smarten Spaces, a fast-growing PropTech startup, is assisting businesses with its back-to-work app—Jumpree WorkSafe— to assist in business continuity as per social distancing norms. Dinesh Malkani, ex-president (India & Saarc) for Cisco, and founder, Smarten Spaces, talks about the anticipated changes at the workplace, current inefficiencies and the role of emerging technologies during and post Covid-19, in an interview with Sudhir Chowdhary. Excerpts:

As the third worst-hit nation, how do you see India reopening its offices and getting people back to work?

Safety and space optimisation are the two topmost priorities. As we prepare for the unlocking phase, companies are trying to identify how to work in this new normal without compromising on the safety of their people. All this requires seamless processes to be integrated into the workplace with transparent communication about guidelines and protocols. Technology can help implement such practices while giving the employees and management a single connected platform for workplace safety.

What would the new workplace look like?

The new normal of the workplace can be categorised into two: ‘Safety and Wellness’ and ‘Flexible Working’ in offices. Processes for safety need to be introduced to check the health and travel history of anyone who enters the premises, contactless services such as employee access, visitor entry, payments, seat and meeting room bookings.

To complement ‘Safety and Wellness’, businesses will need to take a relook at their operations to manage employees working in multiple locations and those coming to work at flexible hours. Managing this increased communication with all stakeholders can be made efficient through a single integrated technology solution at all levels.

What would be the role of technology (AI, IoT, ML) in this?

Companies can reduce their overall space cost by 20-30% by leveraging AI-based technologies for seat and space management. With a possibility of only 10-70% of the workforce returning to offices in a phased manner, businesses can finally implement a completely flexible model for their employees.

This dynamic system with employee information, floor and seating plans, manager controls for intra-team allocation and facilities team synchronisation cannot be done manually. We need a robust integrated technology, which lets you manage and control these multitudes of information levers. When topped with the AI layer, the real estate team also gets insights into what is best suited to minimise space costs and increase efficiency.

How is Smarten Spaces addressing this problem?

Smarten Spaces’ end-to-end AI digital platform disrupts a $19.9 billion smart space industry with a complete solution for businesses to ensure maximum safety, productivity and efficiency at their spaces. Jumpree WorkSafe, an integrated AI technology solution, was developed for workplace-readiness in light of the Covid-19 situation, to ensure employee safety and optimise workspaces. It helps in mapping the employee journey at work. Through a 10-step process, the solution ensures every employee, tenant or visitor is pre-screened for travel and health, tracking every entry and exit along with temperature readings. Employees can select and book seats and view their sanitisation status, book a sanitised meeting room, adhere to social measures at common areas, have staggered lunch breaks and make contactless payments at the cafeteria. It gives the business a central platform to provide instant updates to their employees and share any new protocols, along with one-touch access to the company helpline.

How has the industry responded to Jumpree WorkSafe?

Jumpree WorkSafe has been deployed across leading real estate and enterprise companies in India, UK, China, US, Australia, Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore. Jumpree WorkSafe is used by global technology pioneers, real-estate companies, financial institutions, electronic, engineering companies, and many more. A leading APAC-focused logistics real-estate platform clocked in 100% usage of the ‘Self-Assessment’ feature. One of the world’s largest confectionery companies has noticed an increased employee satisfaction, leading to an 80% adoption, with Jumpree WorkSafe to be deployed in its offices in Chicago, Mumbai, Shanghai, Moscow, Melbourne, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Financial Express,"AI can make workplaces efficient and intelligent: Dinesh Malkani, ex-president (India, Saarc) Cisco",https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/ai-can-make-workplaces-efficient-and-intelligent-dinesh-malkani-ex-president-india-saarc-cisco/2025195/
"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad is collaborating with NVIDIA, a multinational technology company, to establish India’s first ‘NVIDIA AI Technology Centre’(NVAITC) to accelerate research on Artificial Intelligence and its commercial adoption.

"As the world grapples with a new way of life and the COVID-19 crisis peaks, its impact on everyone’s mental and physical health is indescribable.





The pandemic is not only creating a major impact on the global economy, it is also helping to accelerate the development and commercialisation of several emerging technologies that previously received lukewarm consumer response. This is predominantly accurate for innovations that reduce human-to-human contact, automate processes, and increase productivity amid social distancing.









With Artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) rapidly gaining ground in varying forms and degrees, the use of these innovation has begun to appear in a wide spectrum of technologies - from the phones we use to communicate to the supply chains that bring goods to market. It is modifying the way we interact, consume information, and obtain goods and services.





Healthcare is no exception to this new disruption. In the medical industry, the impact of AI, IoT, and other technologies through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), is transforming care delivery.





Data suggests that AI simplifies the lives of patients, doctors, and hospital administrators by performing tasks that are typically done by humans, but in less time and at a fraction of the cost.





It allows patients to track their ultrasounds, thermometers, glucose monitors, electrocardiograms, etc., by being connected through technologies like AI and IoT. These are reinventing and reinvigorating modern healthcare through machines that can predict, comprehend, learn, and act.





A major trend in medicine, when it comes to AI, is using deep learning in medical diagnosis to detect cancer. A recent study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute shows that the AI system has achieved a breast cancer detection accuracy comparable to an average breast radiologist.





With the ability of AI networks to train radiologists, there are chances that their performance will be significantly improved in the nearest future.





Another promising implementation is the use of AI and the Internet of Medical Things in consumer health applications, which allows them to gather healthcare data and process the information and offer adjustments to the current lifestyle of a patient.





Its major purpose is to improve the hospital room experience and simplify the process of preparing patients to continue their healing at home. Also, virtual nurses reduce patient anxiety, improve safety, keep people entertained, and increase patient satisfaction with medical services.





When it comes to medical diagnosis, doctors have seen that applying AI & IoT to medical diagnosis provides numerous benefits to the healthcare industry. AI and IoT based software can tell whether a patient has a certain disease even before evident symptoms appear.





But what AI is extensively helping doctors in is the ease that it is providing in classifying diseases. With deep learning technologies that analyse images and recognise patterns, it is creating a huge potential in generating algorithms that are helping healthcare officials in diagnosing diseases faster.





Moreover, research suggests that AI-driven software can be programmed to accurately spot signs of a certain disease in medical images such as MRIs, X-rays, and CT scans. Existing similar solutions already use AI for cancer diagnosis by processing photos of skin lesions.





By using such tools, doctors are able to diagnose patients more accurately and prescribe the most suitable treatment for them at an earlier stage, resulting in increasing the chances of cancer prevention.





Henceforth, we can say that from patient and self-service to chatbots, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for diagnosis, and image data analysis to identify candidate molecules in drug discovery, AI, IoT and other technologies are already at work.





They are swiftly helping in increasing convenience and efficiency, reducing costs and errors, and generally making it easier for more patients to receive the healthcare they need. While each technology can contribute significant value alone, the larger potential lies in the synergies generated by using them together across the entire patient journey, from diagnoses to treatment, to ongoing health maintenance.

It can easily be said that AI and IoT solutions can lead to better care outcomes and improve the productivity and efficiency of care delivery. They can also improve the day-to-day life of healthcare practitioners, letting them spend more time looking after patients, and in doing so, raise staff morale and improve retention.





It can even offer life-saving treatments to markets faster. With the increased use of AI and IoT in healthcare, it will certainly influence the types of new entrants into the healthcare industry as well as influence how providers, clinicians, and other staff will work in the future.





In India, the last five years have seen consumer-facing ‘health tech’ being talked about and embraced by investors, government, and gradually by the public. Among educated consumers in urban areas, technology is largely gaining traction through online health service aggregators, telemedicine, e-pharmacies, and a few fitness apps. Existing methods are also being used to reinvent healthcare delivery in the form of online consults or chat-based basic healthcare service apps, especially during these unprecedented times.





From a social viewpoint, building greater trust in AI and protecting personal healthcare data will continue to be among the universal challenges. From an administrative standpoint, making it easier for AI to integrate with existing technology infrastructure will certainly help adoption.





For our country, we can conclude that these advanced technologies in healthcare are helping expand the human capacity rather than replacing human labour altogether. Putting us in a unique position to be the driver for AI and IoT technologies in healthcare space for national and international companies.





With large amounts of data and a burgeoning startup community, India has the opportunity to address many healthcare-related problems by using them. With new disruptions in healthcare innovations, we will soon be in a position to realise the benefits of these technologies on health outcomes.





Irrespective of a patient’s location or condition, an evolution of the AI, IoT, IoMT ecosystem will become progressively impactful. And even the most remote locations will benefit from better access to care as connected medical devices continue to find their way into the hands of both patients and clinicians.





Connected health and Artificial intelligence in healthcare is no more a thing of the future, it is slowly transforming the ‘now’ that we are living in.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",YourStory.com,Here’s how connected health and artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare industry,https://yourstory.com/2020/07/connected-health-artificial-intelligence-healthcare-industry
"It’s 2020, and it’s no secret that the world has entered the digital era and that the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has accelerated this process. The impact of COVID-19 has been a wake-up call for pharmaceutical and healthcare leaders, which are now embracing new and innovative technologies to operate in the post-COVID era 1 and to ensure that they are prepared for similar unforeseen crises in the future. From using data to better understand patient preferences—and delivering a personalized experience based on that data—to securely delivering medical information, mastering digital technologies can help pharmaceutical organizations shape the next generation of healthcare.

According to a report by Royal Philips for the 15-country Future Health Index (FHI) 2019, India is a frontrunner in the adoption of digital health technology with 76% of healthcare professionals in the country already using digital health records (DHRs) in their practices. 2 This shows that India’s healthcare industry is moving toward the digitization of their operations in a bid to improve the patient experience.

Top Digital Technologies

Investments in digital technologies, such as mobile, analytics and cloud, have varied by healthcare sector over the years. The new opportunity lies in preparing for the next wave of disruption. Among the top emerging disruptors are DARQ technologies, which have the potential to improve workforce productivity and patient experiences while also reducing the cost of care.

So, what are DARQ technologies? DARQ stands for distributed ledger technology (D), artificial intelligence (A), extended reality (R) and quantum computing (Q). Just as social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies have created new or enhanced business models, such as mobile e-commerce, DARQ is a set of technologies that, when combined, could create the next wave of consumer experiences and business models in healthcare. 3

Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) - DLT enables large-scale collaboration and transactions among strangers – without middlemen or third parties – as well as self-executing smart contracts. This includes technology like blockchain, which will be crucial for secure patient identity and data management. For example, pharmacists could rely on a single, secure database for more efficient access to patient records. Moreover, by aggregating anonymized patient data, a pharmaceutical company could get a market-wide view of a drug’s efficacy in real-world use.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) - AI automates business functions, captures unprecedented amounts of data and enables the benefits of analytics to be more easily accessed. The FHI 2019 report also indicates India meets the 15-country average when it comes to the usage of AI within healthcare at 46%. It can be used to help streamline analytical processes and increase productivity by automating traditionally manual tasks or learning user preferences to reduce the number of clicks it takes to perform a task. This enables more accurate medical analysis and reduces the chances for human error. AI-powered smartphone apps and digital health tools allow patients to self-serve by providing a personalized experience to augment diagnoses and receive custom care options.

Extended Reality - This creates new, immersive environments and provides on-demand information. Use cases for clinical, research and educational purposes is gaining popularity, but the potential is endless. Organizations may choose to equip pharmaceutical reps with augmented reality applications, create virtual prototypes or simulate interactions between molecules in the lab.

Quantum Computing - This can solve complex data sets that may help with discovering new drugs, materials and transforming cyber security.

Apart from DARQ technologies, other forms of emerging solutions include:

o Temperature Monitoring and Sensing - Temperature monitoring and sensing indicators provide vital data to ensure the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products during storage, transit and shipping. Patients are also provided an added layer of security, knowing that their medications have not been compromised during delivery.

o Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) - Patient care requires flawless fulfillment. Global tracking with mobile barcodes and RFID provides operational, actionable data on the location and condition of vaccines and other perishable drugs. RFID embedded tags locate tagged objects in real time. RFID solutions offer pharmacists visibility into prescription stock without the need for manual data entry and accurate unit-dose level data for all products. This transparency helps with the decommissioning of expired or damaged inventory and reverse decommissioning of uncollected medication.

The Latest in mHealth

The scope for leveraging mHealth as an alternate delivery channel in India is substantial. According to data gathered from Google Trends, a tool which analyzes the relative interest in a particular search term, India ranks among the top five countries for search terms like ‘mobile health’, ‘health apps’, ‘medical apps’ and ‘mHealth’. This confirms that the Indian population is interested in mHealth 4 .

The digitalization initiatives undertaken by the Indian government, including the digital biometric identification program (Aadhaar), have created a favorable ecosystem for the digital healthcare market and benefit various e-Gov initiatives like the National Health Portal, e-Hospital, and Integrated Health Information Program (IHIP), which further fueled market growth. Moreover, the steady inflow of foreign direct investment has stabilized the digital healthcare market by addressing the concerns of stakeholders. 5

A large segment of the population (65%) resides in rural areas, where the low-income group lacks access to quality healthcare. Hence, the greatest opportunities lie in providing digital healthcare to patients in remote areas or where healthcare access is limited. With mHealth technology, it is now possible to connect patients to healthcare professionals regardless of distance.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",BW Businessworld,Digital Health Solutions And mHealth To Revolutionize The Indian Healthcare Industry,http://www.businessworld.in/article/Digital-Health-Solutions-And-mHealth-To-Revolutionize-The-Indian-Healthcare-Industry/20-07-2020-299270
"In a first-ever comprehensive initiative, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has announced the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the high school curriculum for the current academic year (2020 – 2021).

Offered for Grades XI & XII across 13 states in India, the AI curriculum has been developed in collaboration with IBM and will be a part of CBSE’s Social Empowerment through Work Education and Action (SEWA) program.

It will be introduced in approximately 200 schools across the states Delhi-NCR, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Kerala, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab.

The IBM AI curriculum is structured around a course framework for students and will consist of the following areas:

Base strands of knowledge such as basics, history, applications

Skills such as design thinking, computational thinking, data fluency, critical thinking

and Values including ethical decision making, the bias in AI.

It will be further made robust with problem-based learning outcomes and assessment methods for teachers, to build foundational skills of AI in students making them not just consumers of AI, but creators as well.

To meet CBSE’s requirements for Grades XI & XII, the curriculum was co-developed with Australia’s Macquarie University and Indian implementation partners – Learning Links Foundation and 1M1B.

The IBM AI Curriculum was launched in collaboration with CBSE in September 2019 with an aim to impart AI skills to 5000 Grade XI students and 1000 teachers across India. Following the program launch, a series of Principal Orientation and Teacher Training sessions were conducted between September 2019 and June 2020. As part of the partnership between IBM and CBSE for the AI Curriculum, training (online and classroom) for over 5000 students were conducted resulting in a cumulative 408 hours of training workshops

“AI will certainly become all-pervasive in our lives in the coming years and it is important to inculcate the necessary skills & knowledge right from high school level. The unique proposition of the IBM AI curriculum is that it allows Grade XI & XII students from all streams, in addition to Computer Science, to build the foundation for themselves to be AI-ready,” said Manoj Ahuja, Chairperson, CBSE.

"Therefore, banks must leverage AI to balance the need for privacy and security with personalisation and engagement. (Representative image)

By Balakrishna DR

Globally, the financial services industry has proved to be an enthusiastic adopter of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven by the availability of data and investment appetite. Creative implementation of AI by start-ups and fintechs has helped further this trend. From personalisation to customer service, fraud detection and prevention to compliance, and risk monitoring to intelligent contract documents, AI has helped banks gain better control and predictability.

Today, customers expect faster, personal, and meaningful services and interactions with their banks and little tolerance for generic unsolicited messages. Therefore, banks must leverage AI to balance the need for privacy and security with personalisation and engagement. That said, the Indian banking sector has some amount of catching up to do.

While Indian banks have explored the use of AI, it has primarily been used to improve customer experience by adding chatbots as an additional interface for customers like SIA by State Bank of India, Eva by HDFC and iPal by ICICI. State-owned banks have been slow to leverage AI, largely because AI implementation requires banks to operate outside of the traditional privacy framework. India still does not have robust data protection and privacy policy. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to take a commanding and dynamic role in framing regulations on emerging technologies, data privacy and ensuring the business interests of the banks.

Banks must adopt new business models simultaneously to integrate AI into their strategic plans and explore the use of AI for analytics and to improve customer experience. However, reliance on legacy systems, lack of data science talent, and cost constraints have impeded seamless adoption of AI. They must focus on three key aspects:

Fraud detection: AI plays a vital role in fraud detection, given the heightened threat of cyberattacks. As per the 2019 RBI annual report, losses due to banking frauds have risen by a whopping 73.8% despite the Government’s efforts to curb them. What is more alarming is that banks took an average of 22 months between the occurrence of fraud and its detection, as per RBI data. Considering RBI’s zero-liability safety net in the event of cyber frauds, it is imperative banks adopt best-fit practices and technology levers to mitigate these risks. With adoption of real-time payments, there has also been rapid innovation in the digital fraud landscape.

Set against this backdrop, banks must deploy context-sensitive AI solutions to enable advanced and adaptive real-time monitoring of their payment networks. These AI solutions additionally leverage relevant data points to assess transaction risk, true identity-matching, and identification of complex typologies and patterns.

Digitisation of processes: The tremendous proliferation of mobile devices and the internet can be leveraged to enable the superior user experience and analytics-based functionalities that give consumers an insight into their spending patterns and provide recommendations on investment and risk profiles. For instance, digitising the KYC process to eliminate the need for physical document submission and verification is something that traditional banks still do not offer. This can be simplified by utilising AI-based computer vision technology to verify documents, Optical/Intelligent Character Recognition (OCR/ICR) technologies to digitise scanned documents, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make sense of them.

Decision making: AI is a great fit in areas where decisions are based on available structured and unstructured data. For example, it can help predict potential loan defaulters and offer loss mitigation strategies that will work for them. It can help determine the best time to approach a customer to sell a new product. AI-based smart environments can collate data from multiple sources and drive an inference and enable SMEs to take decisions. AI can also improve straight-through processing using Intelligent Automation to automate repetitive processes that need decision making.

Given the magnitude of the challenge, it might make sense for banks to come together to establish a consortium for knowledge sharing on AI. This would also help India’s numerous regional and cooperative banks that are behind on the technology curve. A consortium could help uplift these small banks and enable them to be integrated seamlessly into a broader nationwide secure banking network. Whichever way it happens, AI in Indian banking is only set to grow.

"BENGALURU : Major Indian information technology (IT) services companies reported strong growth from digital business in the June quarter, despite the covid-19 impact and global challenges. This helped maintain buoyancy as clients transitioned to work-from-home and demand for cloud, collaboration and cybersecurity-related technologies shot up.

Typically, practices that cover emerging technologies like cloud, mobility, analytics, internet of things, and cybersecurity are clubbed under the digital business. Until recently, most IT services companies separately reported their digital revenues but the trend is changing as digital has increasingly become part of their mainstream offerings.

“Digital is definitely mainstream for IT service providers. Comparing digital revenues across providers can be difficult because different providers use different definitions for digital revenue,"" said Dean Blackmore, senior director analyst, Gartner. “We estimate that in 2019, non-digital IT services revenue was still around 52% of total IT spending. However, by 2023 that will drop to around 31%,"" Blackmore said.

Digital has become so “mainstream"" for Bengaluru-based Wipro, that they have done away with a separate classification for their digital business from the June quarter onwards. “We believe digital has now become a mainstream capability for us and also it has reached a scale where you don’t need to separately call it out as it has become very pervasive for us,"" said Bhanumurthy B.M., chief operating officer, Wipro.

India’s largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd had stopped reporting its digital revenues from Q3 FY20 onwards, as the lines between digital and core offerings were getting blurred.

CIOs aims to optimize costs with accelerated adoption of public and hybrid cloud model, which is driving growth in cloud revenues this quarter, said Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD), TCS.

“Our pipeline from a digital infrastructure and cloud perspective has actually been the highest in the last many quarters. A lot of the large deals that we see is coming from an accelerated adoption of the core infrastructure and compute fabric transformation which is a key enabler for switching to this mode at a large scale basis,"" Gopinathan said in a post-earnings call recently.

Infosys Ltd, which continues to note their digital revenues separately, saw its digital revenue grow 25.5% y-o-y in constant currency to $1.38 billion for the first quarter- ended June, to contribute 44.5% to the total revenue. Earlier this month, Infosys signed a large deal with US investment management firm Vanguard to drive digital transformation of their record-keeping services onto a cloud business platform, which Infosys believes is an indication of strong growth momentum in digital.

“The whole crisis has accelerated the digital thinking across most large enterprises. We see a lot of demand in areas of cloud, workplace transformation, automation, and cost-efficiency,"" Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys, said in the Q1 earnings call.

HCL Technologies along with its partners is helping customers embrace digital transformation to emerge stronger in a post-covid world. “I am confident that, with decisive action leveraging digital momentum and sustainable business practices, we will together emerge as stronger entities,"" said chief strategy officer and MD Shiv Nadar.

Some analysts, however, believe sharing digital revenues separately provided more clarity although some change in reporting structure is inevitable.

“Traditional services like application development and maintenance (ADM), testing and infrastructure support have been under severe pressure for long. So, the focus on digital will continue and especially areas like cloud and customer experience will become more and more mainstream in the coming days,"" said Harit Shah, a Mumbai-based IT analyst.

"Image Source : PIXABAY 'Next 10 years going to be India's golden moments in technology, pharma, e-commerce, manufacturing sectors'

The next 10 years is going to be India's ""golden moment"" in key sectors like technology, pharmaceutical, e-commerce and manufacturing, said a top venture capitalist from Silicon Valley, pointing at the USD 20 billion foreign direct investment in the country amidst the coronavirus outbreak.

""Coronavirus is sweeping the world, especially the US and India. In spite of that, the amount of investment going into India is mind-boggling,"" Silicon Valley’s top venture capitalist, entrepreneur and philanthropist M R Rangaswami told PTI in an interview.

India has received foreign direct investment of over USD 20 billion in the last few months during the coronavirus pandemic, which has had an adverse affect on businesses across the world apart from the over-6-lakh lives the infection has claimed so far.

""I think the next 10 years is the golden moment for India to shine; using digital and technology -- whether it's medicine, telemedicine, e-commerce, logistics -- in every segment of the market. Whether it's a kirana (local grocery) shop, everything is going to be digital. It is the golden moment that India should seize,"" Rangaswami, the software business expert said.

Referring to the series of FDI into India post-COVID-19 outbreak, Rangaswami said it is unprecedented by any standards.

Prominent investments include USD 10 billion from Google, USD5.7 billion from Facebook, USD 1.2 billion from Walmart and USD 1 billion from Foxconn.

""I think there will be many, many more deals this year. You'll see a lot more companies coming in, a lot more money coming in. A lot more investments,"" he said.

""Amazon (e-commerce company) continues to invest in India. Other companies are looking at India now. Private equity guys are looking at India. Sovereign funds will be looking at India. Definitely India is going to be the hot destination for technology money,” Rangaswami said, in response to a question.

He noted that the current President Donald Trump-led administration's anti-China sentiment is also helping India bag big investment.

Relations between the US and China have spiralled downward after Washington criticised the Asian powerhouse's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The US has questioned a new national security law in Hong Kong, treatment of Uyghurs Muslims and security measures in Tibet.

“This gives India an opportunity for an economic game-changer. I think it's predicated by two things. The number of smartphone users (in India) is over 500 million, maybe even close to a billion. Second, the government's push for digital combined with COVID-19 outbreak, which has taken (number of) digital transactions through the roof,"" said Rangaswami, a keen observer of the Indian market.

He said the entire business ecosystem is adopting new technologies like never before -- which not only provides easy solutions in business but also is a market in itself.

""On the ground (during the coronavirus outbreak), everybody is forced to go digital. This is a huge tipping point. So, this is an opportunity I want to see India seize and not let it go to waste,” he said.

""So, what I would request is Indian ministers, key bureaucrats and technology industry leaders put together a roadmap, set of regulations and authorisations so that companies can come in easily. We (must) avoid all the problems of privacy, security in the future,” he said.

According to Rangaswami, India needs to iron-out all the impediments to businesses immediately to ensure smooth sailing for all parties.

""The government needs to lead the charge now, in this moment, and say let's get the leaders together, let's get the bureaucrats, let's get the technology industry, the start-ups, let's get everyone and lay down the rules, regulations, roadmap, so everybody can work to a common purpose,” he said.

"Dealmakers in India will be busier than ever as global investors are going to follow Facebook Inc. and Google in deploying capital into the country, according to Carlyle Group.The South Asian nation has become Carlyle’s No. 2 investment destination in Asia after China, according to Gregory M. Zeluck, its Hong Kong-based managing director and co-head for buyout funds in the region. The U.S. firm has announced two deals in India in the past month -- an acquisition of a 20% stake in billionaire Ajay Piramal ’s pharmaceutical business for $490 million and paying $235 million for a stake in Bharti Airtel Ltd. ’s data-center business.India emerged as a rare bright spot for dealmaking this year, thanks in large part to $19.5 billion of investments in Mukesh Ambani ’s technology ventures from Carlyle’s rivals such as KKR & Co. as well as the likes of Facebook and Google . The Silicon Valley giants are coming after India’s half a billion Internet users, whose growing embrace of everything from e-commerce to messaging and digital payments is drawing comparisons to the early days of China’s technology boom.Overseas investment into both China and India has swelled enormously in the past two decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China receives tens of billions more per year than its Asian rival, yet investment there peaked in 2015, before trade tensions, including the long-simmering dispute with the U.S., began to weigh on deals. By contrast, foreign investment into India last year was 134% higher than in 2015.“China has just taken off in the last decade from an investment perspective and India is sure to follow,” Zeluck said in an interview. “It looks like we are on the inflection point now, this year and next year. I wouldn’t say it is going to explode but it is going to grow very substantially in the next five to seven years.”Carlyle plans to step up investing in India’s media and digital sectors, Zeluck said. While the International Monetary Fund is forecasting that India’s economy will contract as one of the world’s biggest and strictest lockdowns takes its toll, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will potentially be beneficial for health care, he added.“Some logistics may be a bit of issue, getting control of Covid at the beginning can be an issue,” Zeluck said. “Through the economic downturn, particularly pharma may show some upside as well. So pharmaceuticals and health care in general are two verticals that we think are investible at this point in time.”Tensions between China and the U.S. will also prompt supply chains to move into India, Zeluck said. The pharmaceutical industry will be the biggest beneficiary, and electronics and other manufacturing may also see a shift, he added.“We are very excited about India,” Zeluck said. “There were some economic troubles the country has already been facing. But we have a tremendous level of confidence that India will rebound and will be a great investment for the long term.”",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Economic Times,"Carlyle sees India M&A accelerating on pharma, technology deals",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/carlyle-sees-india-ma-accelerating-on-pharma-technology-deals/articleshow/77070601.cms

"Over the past few years, Indian businesses have taken massive strides in adopting new-age technology innovations across sectors. Further, supported by progressive government initiatives like Start-up India, Digital India, Make-In-India, and the recent Vocal for Local, and supportive financial framework, the Indian start-up and entrepreneurial ecosystem has boomed. This is partly also due to the ease of doing business, supported by technology. All one requires now is a disruptive idea, the vision to take it ahead, access to the internet and a few supporting service providers, also available over the internet, and a start-up may be ready to flourish! One no longer needs to put big initial investment in office space, furniture, or machinery to start a company. Take examples of Google which was started in a garage; or Facebook which was started in college; or even Flipkart which was started in an apartment of Bansals!



Speaking of ancillary services, a start-up in the e-commerce space can now have access to third-party service providers like logistics and warehousing companies which can offer to take care of their inventory. Or even social and digital media platforms that offer ‘design your own campaign’ at home, with the click of the mouse, mapping geographic, demographic, and a social-economic class of your target audience! Or even social and digital media platforms that offer ‘design your own campaign’ at home, with the click of the mouse, mapping geographic, demographic, and a social-economic class of your target audience! Same goes for cloud and data hosting service providers, where one can skip the massive 5-year hosting retainers and get a spot on a cloud server on an hourly basis. The best part is that you can get hundreds of servers on the click of a button, use them for a few hours (perhaps to run a machine learning model) and you pay only for those hours.



These are from my prior experiences with various start-ups where I could just host the product on a cloud, do advertising on social media, and my start-up was up and running!



However, despite these technology enablers, the Indian SME/MSME and start-up sector still remain one of the slowest adopter of technology. As a sector that contributes 24% to the national GDP and is one of the largest employers in the country, it also continues to battle challenges like inadequate credit and financial facilities, lack of skilled labour and access to affordable and effective technology solutions, while facing tough competition from domestic and international players.



While the recent pandemic and the resultant slowdown have impacted business, it has also forced the sector to recognise the urgent need of having an effective technology enabled business infrastructure that could help them survive. As per a survey by Nasscom, only a little over 18% of all Indian start-up’s are leveraging deep technology, as of November 2019*. This is a 40% CAGR from 2014 when it was only 8% of all start-up’s. The Indian SME/ MSME sector, on the other hand, also offers a market opportunity from technology adoption that is set to grow at a CAGR of 25%, from US $ 30 billion in 2019, to US $ 85 billion by 2024**. From efficient cloud computing infrastructure that can allow secure work environments for work-from-home settings to data privacy and cyber security have all become major priorities for businesses to sustain during this period of crisis.



While supportive policies, tax holidays, and financial relief packages are all in the pipeline to help salvage the sector which is the backbone of the Indian economy, the government’s vision of enabling it to raise its GDP share from 29% to 50% in 5 years, seems like an uphill task and will depend on a number of factors, including fastrack digital adoption. Key factors that need to be addressed in order to drive digital adoption among SME/MSME, can be listed as under:



1. Digital Literacy:

One of the key reasons for poor adoption of technology is a lack of knowledge about the potential of a solution and poor understanding of technology processes. This often leads to miscalculated decisions which prevent them from adopting new technology. This is true especially in Tier 2 or rural enterprises, which also face a challenge with English language communication and thus often find technology to intimidating. Structured digital literacy programs coupled with solutions that are accessible to non-English language natives, can go a long way in breaking the barrier and making technology more user friendly and understandable.



2. Making technology affordable:

Apart from gaining an understanding about technology solutions, making them affordable is another key factor that largely impacts the decision making process. While most players in the sector are already battling economic slowdown, moving from a conventional to digital format of business can be viewed as an additional investment which may not appear as a top of the list priority. Creating solutions that are affordable, add more value and help generate better ROI for SME/MSME’s, would help drive faster technology adoption.



3. Customised solutions:

While making technology accessible and affordable is an important step to drive technology adoption, customisation of these solutions is a vital aspect that is often a major road block for SME/MSME’s. Creating solutions that offer tailor made solutions to address the specific needs of small businesses can go a long way in encouraging wider and faster technology adoption. From solutions for operations, CRM, HR to more complex solutions for data analysis and management and integration AI and ML for business, technology as a solution needs to be effective, efficient, and impactful, even when dealing on a smaller scale.



4. Skilled labour:

Apart from affordability, accessibility, and customisation, technology solutions for small businesses are also restricted due to lack of skilled workforce. Even after adopting the best solutions, setting up a workforce that can operate and leverage the same effectively on a daily basis, can be a challenge. Unlike MNC’s and larger corporate businesses, SME/MSME’s employ limited labour and may not have the bandwidth to recruit candidates with specialised expertise to access the technology solutions. A technology infrastructure that is in line with the ROI and business solutions needs to be supported with a trainable workforce that can access the same effortlessly.



5. Supportive Digital Infrastructure:

While all of the above factors impact individual entrepreneurs, the presence of a robust digital infrastructure across the business ecosystem is imperative to not only drive initial adoption but to ensure sustained practices and eventually lead to permanent migration of businesses to digital platforms. From a strong fintech infrastructure to seamless integration of new age technology innovations across communications, HR, CRM and Data management, are the new foundation stones for a digitally empowered economy.



Even as India gears up to become an economic superpower by harnessing the people, technology, and global business opportunities across sectors, it’s SME/MSME and start-up sectors continue to grow as the key driving force of the economy. The entrepreneurial spirit, when supported by financial policies and focussed technology solutions, can go a long way in building India as an economic superpower.

"Canadian quantum computing company D-Wave Systems is launching its cloud service in India, giving developers and researchers in the country real-time access to its quantum computers.

Through this geographic expansion, D-Wave’s 2000Q quantum computers, hybrid solvers and the application environment can be used via its cloud platform Leap to drive development of business-critical and in-production hybrid applications.

“Quantum computing is poised to fundamentally transform the way businesses solve critical problems, leading to new efficiencies and profound business value in industries like transportation, finance, pharmaceuticals and much more,” Murray Thom, VP of Software and Services at D-Wave, said in a statement.

“The future of quantum computing is in the cloud. That’s why we were eager to expand Leap to India and Australia, where vibrant tech scenes will have access to real-time quantum computers and the hybrid solver service for the first time, unlocking new opportunities across industries.”

As part of this rollout, users in India and Australia can work on the D-Wave’s Leap and Leap 2 platforms.

The two cloud platforms offer updated features and tools, including hybrid solver service that can solve large and complex problems of up to 10,000 variables; and integrated developer environment that has a prebuilt, ready-to-code environment in the cloud configured with the latest Ocean SDK for quantum hybrid development in Python.

D-Wave’s systems and software have been used in financial modelling, machine learning and route optimization.

Its latest launch in India comes about a year after the country’s Department of Science and Technology (DST) chalked out plans to build its own quantum computers.

In early 2019, DST launched a programme focused on quantum computing, called Quantum-Enabled Science and Technology (QuEST). As part of QuEST, India earmarked ₹80 crore investment to be spent over a span of three years to facilitate research in setting up quantum computers.

A year later, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Union Budget 2020 Speech, announced a National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications (NM-QTA) with an outlay of ₹8,000 crore for the next five years.

“Quantum technology is opening up new frontiers in computing, communications, cyber security with wide-spread applications,” Sitharaman said in her Budget Speech.

“It is expected that lots of commercial applications would emerge from theoretical constructs which are developing in this area.”

NM-QTA’s focus, as outlined by the minister, will be in fundamental science, translation, technology development and, human and infrastructural resource generation.

Other areas of quantum computing applications will include aero-space engineering, numerical weather prediction, simulations, securing communication and financial transactions, cyber-security, and advanced manufacturing.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",The Hindu,D-Wave’s quantum computing cloud comes to India,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/d-waves-quantum-computing-cloud-comes-to-india/article32145904.ece

Few of India’s external partnerships draw the kind of passion that Iran does in Delhi. India’s Iran romance endures despite the huge gap between the hype and reality in ties. The persistent enthusiasm for Iran in Delhi also stands in stark contrast to the perennial under-appreciation of India’s much deeper and wider relationship with Iran’s Arab neighbours.

The theory of the case in Delhi for an extra-special relationship with Iran rests on a number of claims — historical connections, civilisational bonds, energy supplies and regional security. All these factors are of far greater import in India’s engagement with the Arabian peninsula. Millions of Indian immigrants in the Arab nations, massive hard currency remittances from them, and the density of commercial engagement with the Arab Gulf outweigh the relationship with Iran. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have, in recent years, extended invaluable support in countering terrorism and blocked attempts to condemn India in the Muslim world.

The sources of this curious inversion in India’s intellectual imagination are many. But first to the latest anxiety in Delhi about the loss of a railway contract in Iran. Large countries with major foreign investments and projects win some and lose some. That is part of doing business in other countries. Then there is no escaping the political risk associated with foreign projects. And politics — both domestic and international — is all-consuming in Iran.

Editorial | The Chabahar project is important for India’s regional goals, and for its relations with Iran

The sanctions regime imposed by the US has crippled the Iranian economy. It also targets third countries that do business with certain Iranian entities. India is careful not to attract the US sanctions. India did gain an exemption from the US sanctions regime for its participation in the Chabahar port project in Iran. But they don’t apply to some of the partners suggested by Iran in the railway project. Iran would like India to break the US sanctions regime. A prudent Delhi is resisting that temptation. It would rather lose the railway contract than get into the raging crossfire between the US and Iran.

Sections of the foreign policy elite, however, see India’s Iran policy as a continuous purity test for Delhi’s “strategic autonomy”. They expect Delhi to conduct its relationship with Iran without a reference to either a cost-benefit calculus or Iran’s troubled relationship with others with whom India has important partnerships. For the romantics, it is about proving Delhi’s friendship with Tehran by defying the US.

No government in Delhi can buy into that proposition. The criticism of the NDA government today is similar to that directed at the UPA government in 2005 over its stance on Iran’s covert nuclear programme. As the US mounted pressure on Iran to come clean 15 years ago, there was a strong view in Delhi that India should cast its lot with Tehran. But pragmatists pointed to one of the preconditions for the India-US nuclear deal — Delhi’s strong commitment to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Backing Iran in its nuclear confrontation with the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), they warned, would mean killing support in the US Congress for the historic civil nuclear initiative signed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George W Bush in July 2005.

Explained: In China-Iran, India’s concerns

Delhi’s vote against Iran in the International Atomic Energy Agency drew huge fire from PM Singh’s critics. The pragmatists were vindicated when Iran concluded a nuclear deal of its own with the US and major powers, a decade later. Iran surely can take care of its own interests, and there is little reason why Delhi must back Tehran in every one of its fights with Washington.

This does not mean Iran is unimportant for India’s foreign policy. Geographic and demographic size, the geopolitical location next door, natural resources and the extraordinary talents of its people make Iran one of the most important nations of the world. Most of those fabulous assets have been, unfortunately, neutralised by Iran’s prolonged confrontation with the US.

The tendency to view Iran through the lens of its confrontation with the US leads many in Delhi to ignore the ideological character of the Iranian Revolution and the fears generated by Tehran’s promise to export it to the Arab world. Meanwhile, Iran’s four decades-old Islamic order faces frequent domestic rebellions. Iran’s clerical regime has cleavages of its own that complicate Tehran’s global engagement. Tehran’s moment under the sun will come one day. But that moment is not at hand.

For both internal and external reasons, Iran will remain a difficult place to do business. Delhi must advance ties with it within the confines of that unfortunate but real constraint. Meanwhile, the Arab world has had its doors open for political, economic and technological cooperation with India. Three moderate Arab nations — Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE — are confronting radical forces in the region and are valuable partners for India in countering forces of destabilisation.

Those who are worried about India losing to China in Iran should see the scale of Beijing’s economic advances in the Arab world. The talk of a spectacular deal between China and Iran is just talk for now. But there is real Chinese economic action in the Arab world as the region embraces China’s Belt and Road Initiative. China’s Digital Silk Road too is gaining ground in the Arab world.

India is no minor economic force in the Arab world, having had a much longer engagement with the region than China. Instead of defining an unrealistic competition with Beijing, Delhi must up its own commercial game in the Arab world. One of the new possibilities for India lies in the domain of new technologies.

On Monday, the UAE launched the first home-grown Arab space mission from a Japanese rocket. The UAE’s space programme is only a reflection of the emerging sentiment among the Gulf Arabs to reduce the over-dependence on oil, promote alternative energy sources, invest in higher education, and develop technology hubs. This provides a solid basis for elevating India’s economic partnership with the Arab world to the next level. For India, the costs of neglecting the new possibilities for wide-ranging Arabian business are far higher than a lost railway contract in Iran.

Google has become the latest US technology giant to invest in Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries' digital business.

The Alphabet-owned search engine has agreed to pay $4.5bn (£3.6bn) for a 7.7% stake in Jio Platforms.

Reliance's billionaire owner Mukesh Ambani says the two companies will develop phones for 4G and 5G networks.

Google joins a list of new investors in Jio that includes Facebook, Intel and Qualcomm.

""Google has empowered millions of Indians to access helpful information and, like Jio, is a force for change and innovation,"" Mr Ambani said in a statement to shareholders.

Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai said: ""The pace and scale of digital transformation in India is hugely inspiring for us and reinforces our view that building products for India first helps us build better products for users everywhere.""

Earlier this week Google also said the company would invest about $10bn in India over the next five to seven years.

In April Facebook said it would invest $5.7bn for a 9.99% stake in Jio, making it the cut-price Indian mobile internet provider's largest minority shareholder.

The investment arms of US technology giants Intel and Qualcomm have also bought smaller smaller stakes in the company.

""Shopping spree""

Arunoday Mukharji, BBC News, Delhi

Mr Ambani has been on a shopping spree, managing to hook 11 big investors in the last three months and raising over $20bn.

Not only has it helped him remove his net debt of $21bn, he is now looking to expand in the e-commerce space to rival giants like Amazon in India.

His online venture Jio Mart wants to tap into Facebook-owned Whatsapp's 400 million users in India to connect customers with their nearest mom and pop stores - hugely popular in India.

This is why the $6bn Facebook investment in April becomes even more significant.

Mr Ambani also said his company had developed a fully home-grown 5G network. This is important for two major reasons.

First, it fits the script of Prime Minister Modi's repeated push for a self-reliant India.

Second, and more importantly, it seriously damages prospects of tech giants like China's Huawei, which was looking to participate in India's 5G trials.

In the aftermath of the recent border standoff between India and China, the government has been reconsidering all major business engagements with China.

Jio, which is India's newest major mobile operator, grew rapidly to take the number one spot late last year.

Since launching in September 2016 the low cost service has attracted almost 400m subscribers and aims to increase that figure to 500m in the next three years.

In January Reliance announced that it would launch a grocery delivery service that aimed to compete with Amazon in India.

"The Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal had recently asked Indian industry to set up a semiconductor fabrication plant in India, but experts in the sector seem unsure if it’s a pragmatic proposition as the risks are too high and the investment required is too huge.

This comes as a strategic call in the wake of India-China standoff as the government considers the establishment of such facilities as being integral to the development of the electronics industry.

This is not the first time there has been an attempt to set up a semiconductor fab in the country. India has been trying to get a private semiconductor fab since 2006, but all the previous efforts have failed.

Semiconductor manufacturing comprises the front-end fab manufacturing and the back-end assembly, including packaging and testing. There are only a handful of companies globally that do front-end manufacturing at scale.

India has done well in design and verification for the semiconductor industry, with most of the global semiconductor companies having an R&D footprint in India, but 100% of our chips, memory and display are imported into the country. Just on semiconductor chips alone, we are probably looking at around $10-12 billion of imports this year at a minimum.

PVG Menon, President & CEO, VANN Consulting Pvt. Ltd. and former President, India Electronics & Semiconductor Association (IESA) says, “The past track record of the government does not inspire any confidence that the private sector partner will be treated well. When one or two attempts fail, one can blame the private sector, but when successive attempts fail, one has to start critically examining government policy.”

Menon says that the government support to the private sector players is crucial to set up high technology manufacturing like fabs, as has been the case in some countries like the USA, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and China.

“In India, the govt has tended to view each private sector proposal with extreme suspicion. If the govt constantly wants to play the role of a suspicious policeman, rather than the role of a facilitator, then I am afraid we are very far away from setting up National Technology Infrastructure Assets with the help of the private sector,” he says.

India has two fabs — SITAR, a unit of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in Bengaluru and a semiconductor laboratory in Chandigarh, which build silicon chips for strategic purposes like defence and space and not for commercial use.

Semiconductor fabs have investment starting around $8 billion, and the numbers climb rapidly upwards. They have very heavy running costs, and technology needs to be upgraded typically every 3-4 years, say industry watchers.

Menon says an extremely aggressive and consistent fiscal support package will have to be made available to develop the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. “Past history cannot be wished away and I would say that the industry will wait to see the details before they put money on the table.”

Venkata Simhadri, CEO, Moschip says the government needs to understand what the country needs and the type of semiconductor fabs they are talking about.

“Having a land bank is the least important requirement for setting up a fab. It costs billions of dollars to set up a cutting edge CMOS fab and there are only 2-3 companies in the world having that technology and there is no strong motivation or reason for them to set up their fabs in India. In addition, they can’t just rely only on the local market to fill up the capacity in the fab,” he explains.

Simhadri says the the government should Instead focus on developing the fabless semiconductor eco-system in India. “For example, the leading semiconductor companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom and Meditek don’t have their own fabs. India can focus on creating similar companies to develop products focused on Indian market.”

“Government shall come up with a ‘Fabless semiconductor policy’ and a “dedicated fund” to support this initiative. The growing demand for semiconductor components in IOT devices, solar equipment and electric vehicles does not need cutting edge CMOS fabs. Specialty fabs like Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide may have enough demand locally and cost much less to set up. In the short term, India should focus on these specialty fabs and come up with a clear support plan,” he adds saying it’s not just about providing land bank.

The Indian semiconductor component market is expected to be worth $32.35 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 10.1% between 2018 and 2025, according to IESA.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Deccan Herald,Is semiconductor manufacturing in India an unworkable project?,https://www.deccanherald.com/business/is-semiconductor-manufacturing-in-india-an-unworkable-project-863338.html
"NEW DELHI: US-based memory chip manufacturer Micron Technology said that “India is on a good path” to attract assembly and packaging type of investments from the global semiconductor industry, having developed capabilities in smartphone assembly, which has made it the worlds’ second-largest handset manufacturing country.The company said that it is “intrigued” by the new schemes announced by the Indian government.“We are certainly assessing and we'll continue to assess this as part of our long term strategic assessments that we do in the company. But we are continuing to assess these opportunities…we have not made any decisions thus far,” Sumit Sadana, Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Micron told ET over a videoconferencing call.Micron, which is one of only three major DRAM suppliers in the world, also makes NAND memory chips along with SSD, graphics memory and 3D NAND and LPDDR5 DRAM for 4G and 5G smartphones.He said that the government schemes coupled with investments taking place in the infrastructure for transportation, availability of land, power, and water, regulatory approvals for new projects will continue to add to the attractiveness of the country as a manufacturing hub.“We are optimistic about India's long term future when it comes to manufacturing and supply chain. I think India is doing a lot of good things on the policy front level”Semiconductor manufacturing comprises the front end fab manufacturing and the back end assembly, including packaging and testing. Globally, there are only a handful of companies that do actually do front-end leading-edge manufacturing at scale.“For these companies, there are a number of considerations that also make it much more cost-effective to scale up existing facilities, rather than to build up new Greenfield fabs from the ground up in a completely new location and a completely new country,” Sadana said. “Typically, front-end semiconductor manufacturing needs 10-20 years of constant investment at an existing location to get scale and the right cost structure.”Attracting back end assembly could be a good first step for India to create the ecosystem and build capability, he added.“There are significant scale-related issues at play and this type of manufacturing is also extraordinarily expensive from an incentive perspective in order to be competitive with the cost structures. So, some of those challenges have to be addressed for India to be successful on the front end side,” Sadana said.The company has front-end fabs manufacturing facilities in Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, and the US. Its back-end manufacturing facilities are in Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, and China.“We are continuing to diversify the final assembly of our products and we believe that a diversified footprint will give us the resiliency, then we'll be able to be in very well both with the geopolitical environment issues that we are having, you know, any COVID related risks that may come up from time to time,” he said.India recently started accepting applications for electronics manufacturing schemes to strengthen domestic manufacturing of five global and five Indian mobile phone makers.The three Schemes namely, the Production-Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI), Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme, which were notified by the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) on April 1, have a total outlay of Rs 50,000 crore. Apple phone makers Foxconn and Wistron, besides local manufacturers such as Dixon, Lava and Karbonn have already registered for India’s ambitious production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacturing,""There are a lot of positives that India has to offer plenty of talent on the manufacturing side, English speaking population, IP protection, there are lots of those positives that go along with some of the tax-related and other government incentives. India has all the right ingredients to be able to become a hub over the next several years,” he said.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",ETTelecom.com,India may attract investments from global semiconductor players: US’ memory chip maker Micron,https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india-may-attract-investments-from-global-semiconductor-players-us-memory-chip-maker-micron/76954360
"Today (2 July) marks one month of the announcement of three schemes by the government of India through the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) to boost electronic manufacturing in the country as part of its ambitious Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.

From what I know, PLI scheme is getting good traction, but there is no news yet of any semiconductor chip (IC) manufacturers going for the incentives offered in Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Electronics Manufacturing Clusters-2 (EMC2) schemes.

My article titled ""India's big push"" analysing these schemes from the perspective of their usefulness towards realising semiconductor chip (IC) manufacturing units (fabs or foundries) was published by Swarajya on 5 June.

After the martyrdom of Indian soldiers at the hands of the Chinese, I wrote two more articles in Swarajya, out of which, this article explained why India need not go for cutting edge <28nm technology nodes to begin with.

There will be enough market till 2025 and beyond for products from an analog fab with technologies in the 45/65nm to 130/180nm range and a digital fab with say a 28nm and an additional 45nm capability.

An approximate estimate of the investment needed for those two fabs with around 20,000-30,000 processed wafers (that is, wafers each on which multiple chips are fabricated) per month capacity each will be around $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively.

It will also be good if these are part of a cluster of fabs — let us say in addition to these, there is also an R&D fab, a testing facility and a niche III-V fab. A III-V fab, instead of silicon wafers as starting material, uses wafers made out of materials like GaN or InAs or combinations of multiple elements from the III and V groups of the periodic table.

Chips made from III-V wafers could be of much importance in space applications as they work in extreme low-temperatures and also for some high-end power and defence parts or equipment.

My suggested cluster of five fabs is not just coming out of the EMC2 scheme's clause of ""CFCs must cater to at least five units to get 75 per cent incentive"" logic, but also from the need for such ecosystems manufacturing a wide range of chips and components that go as inputs into ATMP units.

I wonder what happened to the Rs 2,500 crore ""GaN fab"" that was proposed two years ago. An initial reading indicates that the end product proposed was ""wafers"" and not ""chips"" — wafer is only the starting material for chips, but that is good too to begin with.

I will be glad to stand corrected that there were also plans to make chips or small components using those wafers, whether it is within the Rs 2,500 crore or not. In fact, I hope that there will be follow up article soon about where that attempt is.

Note that the estimates I gave so far for silicon based analog and digital fabs assume that silicon wafers will be bought, which is what many fabs do.

Setting up silicon wafer making plants will need additional investment and could be considered in India once the wafer-to-chip fabs are in place. I will continue to use the word ""fab"" to mainly mean wafer-to-chip manufacturing units, especially in the context of silicon-based ones.

Each of these fabs could be opened by different foundry players, and each of these could have different investors — in fact, even one big-shot Indian investor or a few getting into the semiconductor fab business will give the much needed boost and confidence to the top foundry players like TSMC or Samsung or GlobalFoundries or UMC or Towerjazz to come set up units in India.

SMIC being Chinese, is better to be avoided. I must also say that we need not wait for investors or players needed for all five fabs, if someone is ready to invest in one, let us say the silicon based analog fab or the III-V and get going, the others will follow — and the differentiation on technology and purpose ensures collaboration than competition among the five.

One month may be too less a time to assess whether SPECS has even reached the doorstep of any big foundry player or investor, leave aside them expressing interest.

However, given that both US (through its ""The American Foundries Act of 2020"") and China (through its ""Made in China 2025"" initiative) have decided to go big in the semiconductor fab space and a $119 billion master plan from Samsung already is on the roll in South Korea. Government of India has to take quick decisions.

The ""next wave"" of foundries have already begun, much of it directly driven by the governments like is the case with the US and China. India need not go for the top of the wave, but can India at least get some momentum?

Let Us Now Examine What Would Be Some Of The Quick Decisions Needed Towards That

In my 25 June article requesting India's Prime Minister for ""3Ds"" — to ""declare intent"", ""dedicate a body or a technocrat"" and to ""develop FPIs to reach Indian investors and eventually FDIs"" , there is also a ""tailpiece"", quoting an article on whether yet another scheme or policy may be in the making to trigger #FabInIndia — perhaps a ""25 per cent before production"" plus ""25 per cent once production starts"" (both of which could be grants or reimbursements that need not be returned to the government) plus a 25 per cent interest free loan.

Until I see such a scheme really come out, I continue to view it as speculation. I see no point in the government waiting to finalise it, or if it is not in the making to deny it categorically. Time is of essence in the semiconductor race. If SPECS is the ""Hobson's choice"", so be it, but say so loud and clear.

A few days back, I had the opportunity to listen at length to Mr ""MA"" (don’t read too much into the choice of the initials, they are just the initials of my name reversed, to keep the identity of the person low profile for now).

Mr MA is part of an attempt to realise #FabInIndia. I asked him, ""are you ready to press the button if the government announces an even bigger incentive than what is offered in SPECS, let us say the 25 per cent + 25 per cent + 25 per cent incentive scheme?""

His reply was calm but firm ""Arun, imagine I have $1 billion. Let us say, I also get $1 billion + $1 billion + $1 billion through government schemes and use the $4 billion for two fabs with the help of one or two global foundry players.

In two to three years when the fabs are ready to ramp up production, how do I ensure that demand for chips will feed my fabs and make sure that the line is running full? If I don't get that assurance, I may just want to put that $ 1 billion as perpetual fixed deposits, even my future generations can live out of the interest earned.""

Mind you, he is not saying without having done a market study — his group apparently has already done a thorough analysis which showed that out of the 78 electronic products used in India, 25 dominate with 95 per cent both in terms of volume and value, and they have analysed the technology roadmaps of the chips that go into it.

The conclusions on the ""which tech-nodes-to-go-for"" match with what I independently presented on 18 June in Swarajya. So the question is not whether the chips produced using those technologies have a market in general.

It is more about what India can do, to ensure that it is the chips produced in India, or by those foundries who have committed to help with #FabInIndia that will be used in products like mobiles or laptops or others that are sold in India or exported out of India.

In short, Mr MA's ask for the government is a preferential market access (PMA) policy for semiconductor chips (ICs) — perhaps it is already there for PSUs, now the request to the government is to implement it for key private sector segments too.

The ""pull"" strategy through PMA could be a substitute or an addendum to the ""push"" schemes like SPECS and is something that the government should seriously consider, especially in a situation if the push schemes still do not trigger #FabInIndia.

I am no expert at this, but let me extrapolate and give an example — perhaps not quite the example that Mr MA is trying — as far as I know, this is not the foundry player that he is in touch with. Let us look at the smartphone market shares in India from first quarter of 2020 and compare with the numbers from various quarters of 2019.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Swarajya,#FabInIndia: Why Creating Demand For Chips Is Key To Boosting Semiconductor Manufacturing,https://swarajyamag.com/economy/fabinindia-why-creating-demand-for-chips-is-key-to-boosting-semiconductor-manufacturing

"On 24 June, in its 8pm show “The Right Stand” CNN News18 presented a hypothesis that China’s aggression against India and attempts to take over more and more of what is rightfully India’s, especially water bodies, is part of its desperation for water, amidst its ambitious growth plans in the semiconductor chip (IC) manufacturing area.

In this article, three pertinent matters will be put forth in the spirit and hope of triggering further debate among those interested:

What is China’s current status in chip manufacturing, that is, the semiconductor fab area and how desperate are they? I will present a summary mainly based on this detailed semi-engineering study that was published recently. How critical is water for China and in particular for the fab industry. I will use some numbers from this 2013 article. Indeed, “much water has flown under the bridge” since 2013, but the indicative numbers and messages are relevant to-date. I acknowledge Lou Hutter for pointing to the link and confirming some of my back- of-the-envelope calculations towards point #3 below. What does it translate to India’s ambition to get into the semiconductor fab space vis-a-vis its water availability and what should India do?

For those who may get lost in the details of the article referred to in point #1, the summary is as follows: China started its efforts as early as the beginning of this century to get global players like Taiwan-based TSMC, UMC and some companies in the memory chip area, to boost in-house chip manufacturing.

Parallelly, it helped local players grow — most prominent being SMIC which holds 4.5 per cent market share globally among foundry players as per first quarter 2020 data presented here. Also, as per figure 3 of this article, in 2019, foundry or the chip fabricating market was about $74 billion, while in the same article, figure-1 shows the overall semiconductor market, more in terms of the products, was about $430 billion.

The semi-engineering article referred earlier, in its figure, shows a dip in China’s consumption from $145 billion in 2018 to $125 billion in 2019. While that is a case of curiosity both in the wake of American restrictions and Covid-2019, I shall not divert.



The point of interest for us is that China produced $19.5 billion worth chips in-house, which out of its domestic need of $125 billion is about 15.6 per cent and out of a global $430 billion is about 4.5 per cent — that also seems proportional to SMIC’s market share in the global foundry space.

SMIC itself may be making some chips for non-China players, including possibly for India or at least chips designed in India, but it is not likely to be a big percentage of its revenue and so, one can deduce that while players like TSMC and UMC have their fabs in China, it may not be a significant portion of their overall production either and adds only little to China’s global share — the companies themselves may be there for strategic and consumer market diplomacy reasons.

Here is the crux — China has set an ambitious target of producing 70 per cent of its chip needs in-house by 2025 — assuming a $220 billion consumption, that is around $150 billion. Product space going from $19.5 billion to $150 billion, if translated linearly into the foundry space, would mean going from roughly $3.5 billion to about $27 billion in a matter of five years.



That sounds way too ambitious, and the US restrictions have only worsened it.

With multiple examples as quoted in the semi-engineering article on what global players are not allowed to do in or for China, it is only natural that China tries to do whatever it can for the domestic companies, including ways to catch up on advanced technology nodes like 3nm, 5nm, 7nm and 10nm that its players have been lagging behind in.

So, the desperation to increase in-house chip (IC) manufacturing as presented in CNN News18 is surely there, but whether the water needs that it brings along is the only or the main reason for China to attack India is debatable.



In any case, not just for fabs, water is increasingly becoming a precious resource globally and many even believe that “the third world war will be fought over water”.



The percentage needed for fabs is quite likely only a blip in the amount of water needed overall.

So then, if India goes for semiconductor fabs, which I hope it does soon, how much does that add to India’s water risk? For the kind of fab I had proposed in this article, it will be anywhere between 8,000 to 12,000 litres of water needed per wafer.



Let us take the average 10,000 litres. Anywhere between 30,000 to 50,000 wafers per month will be a reasonable capacity to have — let us again keep it at 40,000 or about 1,350 wafers a day.

So that is 13,500,000 (13.5 million) litres of water needed per day.



The per person availability of water in India is predicted to be 1,465,000 (1.465 million) litres by 2025.



So a fab in one day consumes the water availability of 9.21 Indians and over a one-year period, that of about 3,363 Indians — my understanding is that this is the ‘available, usable’ water and not what the person physically uses.

This ORF study mentions that most of India’s usable water goes into agriculture and even by 2025, it will still be around 83.3 per cent.



If one were to compare with average water used by Indians for drinking and domestic needs and take 135 litres as an average based on this detailed study, the fab above would daily consume water equivalent to household usage of 1 lakh Indians.

Another data point to compare would be India’s textile industry — this article gives the number as 425 million gallons or 1,608 million litres of water used per day.



In comparison, 13.5 million litres is less than 1 per cent.

This is not to say that we should neglect India’s water challenges — especially the non-equitable distribution. India is a country that can simultaneously have floods in one place and drought in another.



Once the water available per capita comes in the range of 1-1.1 million litres per day, the country will be water-stressed.

I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to calculate how much time in seconds it takes for the amount of water needed in a fab per day as mentioned above, to go into a hydro electric power station that produces, say 1,000 MW of power.



Indeed, the water that turns the turbine is then used for other purposes, irrigation for example.

In fabs too, “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle” will be the key, and while total reuse may not be possible in fabs, the article referred earlier — this — gives multiple examples of efforts done by fabs to reduce and recycle, including the example of what Intel's fab has done in Arizona, USA.

The need for water recycling is not limited to just fabs — quoting from the ORF study:



“75% of water pollution from domestic waste water is today discharged untreated into local water bodies and rivers. This amounts to around 40,000 million liters per day MLD from its 300 odd cities"".



Clearly, there is much desired on the water recycling aspect.

Associating fabs with desalination plants is also an option. Apart from the water needs that a fab brings, with a growing population and water-stressed cities, India in general has lessons to be learned from countries like Israel, UAE, Singapore and so on, and proactiveness in this regard can only help India.

The attempt here has been to show that availability of water should not be the main hindrance for a fab in India, though, indeed, it will have to be ensured that the water supply to fabs never runs dry and India's overall water challenges of the present and the next few decades be taken up seriously now itself.

A similar study can also be done about the power needed for fabs.



Those interested may want to read about “Independent Power Producers” (IPP) in India, some of which started because they had industries needing a lot of power. Fabs need uninterrupted and non-fluctuating power, approximately 50 MW for a medium sized one.



A combination of IPPs using, perhaps, both solar and thermal, along with the state government provided power through the grid may be the way to go — today’s India can make it happen.

Whether China’s aggression on India is for water or not, isolation is prompting it to take the challenge of in-house chip manufacturing with more vigour.



Union Minister Ravishankar Prasad confirmed in an interview to Swarajya recently that “Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is also working on a separate policy towards setting up semiconductor FAB in the country”

India should not limit itself to just announcing incentive schemes, and hoping investors will get to know. Steps should be taken to ensure that it is the chips produced (fabricated) in the country that will be used in products like mobiles or laptops sold in India or exported out of the country.

Given the multi-dimensional aspects of semiconductor fabs, and the scepticism after previously failed attempts, India’s Prime Minister himself will need to trigger efforts.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Swarajya,"The Chip-Water Angle To China’s Aggression May Be A Stretch, But There Are Lessons To Be Learned",https://swarajyamag.com/technology/the-chip-water-angle-to-chinas-aggression-may-be-a-stretch-but-there-are-lessons-to-be-learned

"NEW DELHI : On 13 July, a day before Bengaluru went into lockdown again, industrialists clamoured to make virtual representations to the state’s chief secretary among other officials. The request: factories should be allowed to operate

“It is very difficult to start, stop and then re-start,"" Kamal Bali, president and managing director at Volvo Group India, who was part of the calls, later told Mint. “The lockdown could be for a week but the problem is to get the supply chain back up again,"" he added. The company runs three plants in Bengaluru.

Karnataka eventually allowed factories to operate but the prospect of “stop-start"" continues to worry industry captains. In the last one month, across the country, different manufacturers had to temporarily suspend operations as employees tested positive for covid-19.

Such disruptions have bolstered the case for more automation in Indian factories—a significant change as Indian business has always preferred cheap labour to expensive machines. Now, nearly every large and small company’s scenario planning is about doing more stuff with technology.

“Automation should meet certain goals and those goals have enhanced post the pandemic. How do we run our factories if there is another pandemic? Can I run my factory at 70% capacity through remote monitoring of processes?"" Bali asked. “We need to ensure that our dependence on manual labour is gradually reduced. Our next level of investments would be more on automation than anything else,"" he said.

The reverse migration of labour, even though temporary, has raised alarm bells. And then, there are social distancing rules. Machines, unlike men, can ensure contact-less manufacturing. Little surprise, companies selling automation solutions have reported spikes in demand.

Robot maker Universal Robots said enquiries from fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are up by 10-15% (the medical equipment sector is understandably reporting 50% growth in enquiries) compared to pre-covid months. Milagrow HumanTech, a maker of service robots, said that unit sales of robotic vacuum cleaners jumped 400% in the June quarter compared to the same year-ago period.

On the software side, IBM cited a three to four times increase in the number of requests from mid to large companies to automate processes.

“It is very clear that the pace of automation adoption is accelerating,"" Anu Madgavkar, partner at McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), said. “Back-of-the-shop occupations, such as accounting, business operations, payroll processing, and HR work among others, were anyways getting automated. Now, front-of-the-shop type of occupations are getting automated faster. This includes sales and marketing and a class of occupations where knowledge and expertise is scarce,"" she added. As an example she cited repair work in hi-tech manufacturing, which can now be guided remotely through virtual reality.

The harsh reality is that as India presses the accelerator on automation, it would displace jobs over the short to medium term. One robot can replace three or more people.

A 2019 study by MGI found that in India, 44 million men and 12 million women were at risk of being displaced by automation by 2030. MGI chalked out different scenarios and these assumptions reflected a “mid-point"" scenario. That displacement could occur much sooner with the covid-19 reset.

The automated future, while necessary, raises difficult questions. India will go through a period of painful adjustment where the workforce would need to be upskilled since tech-enabled jobs come with a higher skills bias. Considering India’s large demographic, how easy will that be? And when must India start re-tooling its workforce?

“This is a question which is up in the air. It is discussed at every industry forum, at every government interaction. People have different ways of looking at it—some cynically, some positively,"" Sandeep Maini, chairman at Maini Group, a diversified manufacturer, said.

“The fact is automation is the future and we have to upskill. Instead of plotting various scenarios and the timeline by when it could happen, we need to get down to the job. Covid-19 is a trigger to do things much earlier than you wanted to,"" he added.

The low-cost drive

Make no mistake, India already has a sprinkling of the very automated or smart factories. Multinationals and large Indian corporates have invested in greenfield plants that comply with Industry 4.0 architecture. That’s about the integration of operational technology with information technology and these factories rely on a range of cutting-edge technology such as smart sensors, collaborative robots, Internet of Things, cloud computing, human-machine interfaces, 3D printing and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver productivity that is the best in class.

There’s GE’s precision engineering factory at Chakan near Pune, Mondelēz India’s chocolate-making facility in Andhra Pradesh’s Sri City, Bosch Ltd’s automotive products plant at Bidadi, Volvo Group’s diesel engine factory at Pithampur in Madhya Pradesh, Honda’s scooter plant at Vithalapur in Gujarat, and Lloyd’s air conditioner factory in Rajasthan’s Ghiloth, among others.

And yet, India ranks low in the pecking order of robotic adoption—11th in annual robot installations globally with under 5,000 units installed in 2018, data from the International Federation of Robotics showed. In comparison, China installed 154,000 robots and Japan 55,000.

Now, auto component makers are expected to take the lead, but higher adoption is also expected from engineering and electronics manufacturing firms. The small are unlikely to invest in Industry 4.0 technologies, which is way too capital intensive. Low-cost automation, where returns can be had within a year, could be in vogue.

Tushar Arora is the fourth generation in the family that owns Abilities India Pistons & Rings Ltd, a manufacturer whose products are used in two-wheelers. He takes this writer around his factory, in Ghaziabad. The campus has many sheds, built around a lawn and a temple. Inside the plants, employees wear both a face mask and a face shield as they work the machines.

The company started in 1968 and over the decades accumulated many machines that are no longer fancy. Older machines have now been retrofitted to bring them up to speed. “Many manual processes have been automated. Over the next few months, we will get rid of the pick-and-place activity. It is repetitive,"" Arora said.

“Pick and place"" refers to labourers picking up components from one tray or machine and feeding it to a second machine. Abilities India is investing in a gantry, which will now automate this activity. A gantry is sort of a low-cost robot with a vertical and a linear motion. Bigger companies rely on more sophisticated robots to do the same work.

“We currently make 100 parts an hour with seven people in a line. With the new automation, we are targeting 120 parts an hour with five people. If I save two people in one shift, it is a saving of six in three shifts. Defects would go down by 50%,"" Arora said. “With the pandemic, people are still reluctant to come back to work. A lot of the things we had planned for the longer run has become short-term now,"" he added.

Bot playground

In one corner of Milagrow’s office in Gurugram stands RoboJulia, named after Julia Roberts, and RoboDiCaprio, named after Leonardo DiCaprio. They are humanoids—while Julia, 5.25ft tall, is a restaurant delivery robot, DiCaprio is a mobile exhibition robot that can greet visitors and guide them. Both the robots are capable of deciding their own path on a floor.

“Robotic technology has to be like human beings. Until and unless there are degrees of freedom, the robot is of no use,"" Rajeev Karwal, founder of Milagrow, said. “These robots form their own map. In a restaurant, the robots can decide in real time what is an obstructed area.""

It’s early days—Julia, launched recently —but Karwal thinks this is the future, thanks to social distancing. For now, demand for his other service robots, like floor cleaners, is at a tipping point.

“We had given up on the B2C space (top-end floor cleaning robots are expensive and can cost ₹80,000). About 70% of the sales came from facility and hospitality management companies. Post covid, the trend has reversed. Senior citizens never bought robots earlier. Now, 25% of the demand is from senior citizens,"" Karwal said.

Home automation could indeed be the next frontier for robotics but as of now, in the services industry, it is software bots and AI that rule the roost.

A year ago, IFFCO-Tokio General Insurance Co. Ltd introduced an AI-based quick claim settlement tool for car claims. Using IBM’s computer vision and deep neural network-based techniques, the system figures out the extent of the damage to a car. The machine was fed with 10,000 images of damaged vehicles—the more pictures fed, the more it learns.

The company’s customers upload photos of damaged vehicles through an app. “Looking at the photographs, the tool tells us the actual list of parts that are due for repair or replacement. We have limited ourselves to 50 personal car models,"" Seema Gaur, executive director and head of IT at IFFCO-Tokio General Insurance Co. Ltd, said.

The company no longer requires a surveyor to make a physical visit to inspect the vehicle. “This has reduced our turnaround time. Earlier, a surveyor was engaged and the process took two-three days. With AI, we are now able to do it within minutes. The machine gives an estimate of the reimbursement and it is up to the customer to accept or reject it,"" she added. The firm has settled more than 10,000 claims through the AI tool thus far.

Software bots have evolved at a fast clip. In fact, bots now have a certain amount of cognitive understanding. They have also evolved from automating high-volume repetitive work, like in a BPO, to executing unique work such as claims settlement. They are in demand.

“The ability of companies to service customers is going down because employees are working from home. Those who have already invested in automation are finding it easy to respond. Those who have not are looking to automate at a faster pace,"" Kamal Singhani, managing partner of global business services at IBM India/South Asia, said. A robotic process automation (RPA) investment can potentially reduce cost of operations between 30% and 70%, he added.

The tough transition

There are many flavours to the nature of labour displacement. Robotic process automation eliminates the white-collar worker. Robots on the factory floor replace the blue-collar. Home automation could replace millions of “maids"" India’s middle class employs as prices of cleaning robots fall.

Nonetheless, over the next decade, many new jobs are expected to be created. But those displaced could find it harder to make the new occupational transitions. Women, particularly, may find it tougher to upskill themselves for the newer opportunities, exacerbating inequities.

Sabina Dewan, president and executive director of JustJobs Network, a think tank, pointed out that white-collar workers could be better off because they have both access (to different resources) and training, whereas blue-collar workers are at a competitive disadvantage.

“There are also differences across businesses in their ability to adopt sophisticated technology, invest in training, and reap higher productivity gains, versus those that can’t afford to do so. These inequities among workers and businesses means that technology is likely to deepen the inequality in our economy; inequality is eventually bad for growth,"" she said.

The task ahead, for governments and corporates, is cut out. They have to shore up small businesses and workers through access to affordable technology, skilling, basic social security. And, focus on data sharing agreements.

“Governments have limited information on plans to automate which makes it hard for them to plan. Companies have a tonne of data that they keep to themselves. Data would be invaluable in helping policymakers understand the scope and scale of change and hedge for it,"" Dewan said.

"While robotic surgeries offer precise and accurate results, the cost associated has always been a barrier for it to be widely accepted. But, Apollo Hospitals Chennai is one such healthcare provider that has reduced the cost per procedure of robotic colorectal surgeries, making it similar to the cost of a laparoscopic procedure.

Recognised as the headquarter of Apollo Hospitals, Apollo Chennai is a 560 bedded hospital with 15 operating rooms and is also one of the only three dedicated colorectal units in the country. With the aim of conducting more reconstructive procedures, avoid colostomy and offer patients with better postoperative benefits, Apollo Hospitals deployed robots for their colorectal surgeries.

Conventional laparoscopic techniques involve 2D images, limited range of motion and are challenging for doctors as they have to manage the screen and instrument simultaneously. However, with robotics, the Apollo Chennai surgeons are provided with 3D vision, enhanced dexterity and greater precision, making it possible for them to perform complicated dissections or reconstructions with much ease.

“Robotic-assisted surgery has been a breakthrough in healthcare by bringing in an incomparable degree of precision to minimally invasive surgeries,” said Dr Venkatesh Munikrishnan — the consultant robotic colorectal surgeon and clinical lead at Institute of Colorectal Surgery, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai. “It makes the complicated procedures simpler with its 3D imaging, enhanced accuracy, precision in surgical depth and bionic arm that offer excellent outcomes.”

Robots To The Rescue

In order to provide its patients with exceptional surgery outcomes, Apollo Chennai equipped their operating theatres with the da Vinci robot, a four-armed surgical robotic system used for treating rectal cancers. Developed by Intuitive, this robot proved to be beneficial for complex cases where doctors need to deploy a minimally invasive approach.

Here the robots don’t do the operations on their own; instead, the robot arms imitate real-time hand movement of the surgeons at the console, which allows it to bend and rotate the surgical instruments to do small incisions and perform operations. This makes it the best friend for a surgeon.

Unlike conventional laparoscopy, robotic-assisted surgeries come with some significant benefits like less blood loss, minimal tissue damage, shorter postoperative stays and faster recoveries. While in traditional techniques, “doctors had to stand for long hours with rigid instruments while operating these complex surgeries,” with robots, the same can be done in less time as with a lot of precision.

The versatility and the flexibility of the robot make this one of the prefered choices for Apollo Chennai, which not only comes with setup automation but also with ways to enhance the efficiency of the operating room. It provides multi-quadrant access, which helps in complex operations, and dual grip technology, in which doctors can switch the grip strength without switching the grasper. The robot also has single-site technology which enables one incision surgery.

According to the doctor, robotic-assisted surgeries have been a boon to the hospital surgeons, giving them immense control over the surgery. “Shorter operation time of each case improved the efficiency of the surgeons, and now he is able to complete more surgeries in a single day.” Further, he stated that considering the post-surgery benefits of RAS surgeries, patients at Apollo Chennai started demanding it over conventional laparoscopy or open surgery, which are highly invasive.

“I perform 90% of my work through robotics, mainly in the areas of colon and rectal cancer,” said Dr Munikrishnan.

Apollo Chennai Managed The Cost Of The Robot

Robotic surgeries come with scepticism for many hospitals and doctors due to the involvement of high costs. “As this is a big investment, the capital costs are naturally high, and many hospitals fail to ensure enough volumes,” said Dr Munikrishnan further said.

“However, for Apollo, the higher costs get balanced with the benefits offered by the robotic surgeries, like a reduced length of stay, quicker recovery, less blood loss and reduced conversation rates when compared to open surgery and laparoscopy. The hospital decided to incorporate the technology with a unique high- volume program, where the cost of instrumentation is reduced at large scale, which in turn brings down the cost of the procedure, and making it equivalent to a laparoscopic procedure, ” stated the doctor.

A lot of this could be attributed to the larger volumes of well- trained surgeons completing a higher number of surgeries in a single day, thus reducing the costs. These robots also lessen the burden of the surgeons by reducing the operating time and therefore allow them to take a greater number of cases in a day.

The hospital, till date, has conducted about 430 colorectal surgeries, out of which Dr Munikrishnan claims to have worked on 380 operations, maximum till date in the country.

Wrapping Up

“With more and more surgeons and patients becoming aware of the benefits of robotic surgery,” the trend is going to catch up in the coming years. The only challenge persists, is the associated costs, which, according to the doctor, “can be dealt with proper planning.” However, the clinical and the functional outcome made RAS the frontrunner for Apollo Chennai.

"When India is handling a once-in-a-century pandemic, countries, and factories are going into lockdown again. Industrialists clamored a virtual representation demanding factories to operate. But it is very difficult to start, stop and re-start. Problem is not the lockdown, it will stay for a week, a major concern is to back-up the supply chain again across the country. Whereas in Karnataka, factories were allowed to operate but to manage the start-stop situation brings the industries captains the biggest drop. On the other hand, different manufacturers suspend their work temporarily as their employees were tested positive to Covid-19.

Such disturbance in the industry causes the Indian factories to bend towards the automation sector. A drastic change is forthcoming in the Indian industries where companies usually preferred cheap labor in comparison to expensive machines. But now every small and large company is adapting to new technologies to work with. It seems like Automation will be the one in the majority post the pandemic. This will boost India’s technology sector. However, it will gradually reduce the dependence on manual labor. Thus, an increase in unemployment, especially for the poor.

In the past months, companies selling automation tools saw a sudden increase in demand.

Machine, unlike men, can ensure contact-less manufacturing fulfilling the social distancing rules. Companies like Universal Robots and Milagrow HumaTech saw an increase in sales as compared to the same period last year. FMCG sectors are reporting 10-15% growth in the inquiries for robot makers and medical equipment sectors to show 50% growth in inquiries. Milagrow sales of vacuum cleaner grow by up to 400% in the June quarter.

On the other hand, software companies like IBM also saw a three to four-fold increase in the middle-sized and large-sized companies enrolling for the automated process. Understandably, the pace of automation in Indian industries are boosting. The back-office operations such as accounting, HR, payroll processing, were already in the process of getting automated. Now, the automation in the front-office operations is also accelerating. Soon, all the operations will be used by machines. The harsh reality is that, though it will provide a job opportunity for those who know machines and automation because of their regular maintenance and updating. But what about the manual labor workforce, who does not have such advance knowledge. One robot can easily replace three or more people.

In the study by MGI in 2019, it was estimated that about 44 million men and 12 million women will be replaced by the acceleration in automation technology by 2030. It appears that due to the sudden spread of Covid-19 and businesses to re-open, this displacement will occur much sooner. Robotic process automation will replace the white-collar worker, Robotics on the factory floor will replace the blue-collar workers and Home automation will replace millions of “maids”.

While the automated future is necessary India will have to go through difficult adjustments where the manual workforce will be the one highly effective. They will require some upskilling in the tech field. This can be good as many individuals will be open to more skills. India already has some automated or smart factories, including MNCs and large companies. They have invested in various greenfield plants that comply with Industry 4.0 architecture. While many countries are already working on technologies like smart cities and IoT. Now India will be open to all of that with the integration of operational technologies and information technologies providing India with technologies like smart sensors, Internet of Things, collaborative robots, cloud computing, human-machine interface, 3D printing, AI, and many more.

Now, auto component generator such as GE’s precision in Pune, Bosch Ltd. automation plant is Biladi, Volvo Groups in Madhya Pradesh, and many more are expected to take a lead. The large companies can adopt these technologies unlike them, small companies do not have much knowledge about Industry 4.0, and they even find it too capital intensive.

"The robots are very easy to use, safe to be around and can easily be adapted to new tasks ~

CHICAGO: While a resurgence in coronavirus cases in Texas has brought many businesses to a screeching halt, eight robots have kept All Axis Machining's metal fabrication facility in Dallas humming.The small, nimble robots perform multiple jobs, such as machine-tending, sanding, deburring, part inspection and laser marking, leaving owner Gary Kuzmin far less dependent on manual labor. When all the workers on one shift went into self-quarantine last month, it had no impact on the facility's productivity.All Kuzmin had to do was to move a couple of workers from other shifts to supervise the robots. ""I have not lost any spindle time because of the pandemic,"" he said.Companies of all sizes are leaning on automation to keep factories running without compromising the health and safety of their workers. Half of the chief financial officers surveyed last month by PricewaterhouseCoopers said they were planning to accelerate automation.With the U.S. economy grappling with a double-digit unemployment rate, however, industry 's rush to robots will fuel worries about semi-skilled or unskilled workers as low-paid, routine tasks become more likely to be automated.""It is the most productive thing for us to have the robots,"" said Kuzmin. ""I don't even look at a machine these days without thinking how I would automate it.""Since August 2018, when All Axis Machining began using robots, its productivity has doubled with the same headcount. If not for the robots, the company would have needed to expand its staff of 30 by 50% to keep up with increase in demand.""We are less dependent upon a semi-skilled employee,"" said Kuzmin.The pandemic has changed companies' calculations about investments in automation, said Jeremie Capron, research chief at research and investment-advisory firm ROBO Global. ""The cost of operating without a robot today in a factory is higher than it was pre-COVID,"" he said.Mark Muro, senior fellow and policy director at Washington-based the Brookings Institution, says the automation drive will result in a net reduction in the workforce as companies invest in technology not just for social distancing, but also to boost productivity and protect profits from the pandemic-induced recession.""Technology has improved and gotten cheaper, and the financial pressure on companies is higher,"" he said.He noted, however, that since middle class and lower-paid workers tend to spend a larger share of their income than the higher-paid, it is important that productivity gains eventually result in more jobs.""If there is... too little sharing of the gains of automation-supported growth, we will wind up with little economic activity,"" Muro said.The affordable cost of the so-called collaborative robots, or ""cobots,"" promises payback in months, making the changeover easier, even for small and medium-sized enterprises.All Axis Machining, for example, spent $85,000 per robot and was able to recover the cost in five months. There are cheaper collaborative robots on the market, as well.One of the most popular cobots sold by Denmark-based Universal Robots - a unit of Massachusetts-based Teradyne Inc. and a market leader in collaborative robotics technology - costs about $35,000, with a payback period of three to four months.The robots are very easy to use, safe to be around and can easily be adapted to new tasks. It takes just hours to train employees to work with them, saving companies huge training expense.Although they are not suited for heavy-duty jobs, they are designed to work alongside humans, making them the robots of choice in the age of social distancing.California-based DCL Logistics, a third-party logistics company, decided to employ cobots to manage a 30% increase in orders in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak.Normally, the company would have hired temporary workers to deal with the surge in orders. But bringing in new workers was fraught with safety risks, said Chief Revenue Officer Brian Tu. The robots have led to a 300% increase in productivity and a 60% jump in labor cost savings, Tu said.DCL plans to deploy more cobots this year at its facilities in California and Kentucky.At All Axis Machining, the cobots have allowed owner Kuzmin to stagger the shifts. The facility now runs three shifts seven days a week, with robots working the late night shift alone, without any roving inspector.This has allowed workers in the facility to stay 30 feet apart from each other. Having seen the benefits, the company is automating its remaining machines as well.Kuzmin, who also runs a robotics services company, says several Dallas-based manufacturers have approached him recently to install similar robots in their factories.Universal Robots is fielding inquiries from companies seeking social distancing solutions, as well as tools to re-shore production and make their operations more flexible.""Some companies... are talking about dozens and dozens of robots,"" said Joe Campbell, senior manager of applications development at Universal Robots.Still, the virus-induced recession is keeping many companies on the sidelines, wary of making new investments.Tacoma, Washington-based Tool Gauge, which makes metal and plastic parts and assemblies for aerospace companies, including Boeing Co. , planned to add two mobile industrial robots to its fleet of two cobots and 10 industrial robots before the novel coronavirus hammered the aviation industry.But Tool Gauge put the robots on hold after a production shutdown at Boeing's Washington state factories and an overall drop in orders, General Manager Jim Lee said.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",ETAuto.com,Coronavirus pandemic advances the march of 'cobots',https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/coronavirus-pandemic-advances-the-march-of-cobots/77078124

"Reliance’s Jio Platforms has developed a homegrown 5G solution that is expected to be deployed next year when test spectrum is made available by Indian telco regulators.

Speaking at Reliance’s recent annual general meeting, company chairman Mukesh Ambani said the complete solution will enable it to launch a world-class 5G service in India, adding that the solution can also be exported to other countries.

Ambani said because of Jio’s converged IP architecture, the telco can easily upgrade its existing 4G network to a 5G network. The company is also setting a goal to pursue the global 5G opportunity and to create a significant source of revenue from both domestic and global markets.

“I believe that the time has come for a truly global digital product and services company to emerge from India and to be counted among the best in the world,” he said.

Jio Platforms has teamed up with partners to realise its ambition. At the virtual meeting, Ambani announced that Google is investing $4.5bn for a 7.7% stake in Jio Platforms. The two parties will also work together to develop a version of Android for low-cost smartphones.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the investment in Jio Platforms will help to improve smartphone access in India and the mobile experience.

“Today, people in India no longer have to have to wait for technology to come…and at the same time, smartphones and affordable data have made it possible for a billion Indians to come online,” Pichai said. “But there’s more work to do to connect every Indian to the opportunity that technology creates.”

Meanwhile, Jio Platforms has also deepened ties with Qualcomm, whose investment arm Qualcomm Ventures is investing $97m “to support Jio Platforms on its journey to rollout advanced 5G infrastructure and services for Indian customer”.

Qualcomm said the investment will translate into 0.15% equity stake in Jio Platforms, which has more than 388 million subscribers.

In 2019, the number of smartphone subscriptions in India stood at 620 million and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9%, reaching one billion by 2025, according to Ericsson’s June 2020 mobility report.

The report noted that 5G will represent around 18% of mobile subscriptions in India at the end of 2025. Mobile broadband technologies accounted for 58% of mobile subscriptions in 2019, and this figure is predicted to reach 82% by 2025.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",ComputerWeekly.com,India’s Jio Platforms eyes global 5G opportunity,https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252486342/Indias-Jio-Platforms-eyes-global-5G-opportunity

Reliance Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology, according to sources. The company’s wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies.

According to sources, Reliance Jio on July 17 requested for 800 megahertz of frequencies in the 26 gigahertz (Ghz) and 24 Ghz band as well as 100 Mhz in 3.5 GHz band for running field trials in “urban centres like Delhi and Mumbai”.

“Jio has said that high frequencies has been put to use in advance countries like the US, South Korea, Japan, Canada, the UK.

This is key development as far as 5G in India is concerned. India, just like it was late to 4G, is late to 5G networks given that some countries already have operation 5G services available to consumers whereas many other are already doing field trials for the next-generation network.

However, with its today's announcement, Jio hopes to change the situation by next year. The company said that it will rollout the Jio 5G plans in India for trials as soon as the government goes ahead with releasing the spectrum for the next-gen networks. Jio says that it will be ready to test the 5G Jio services as soon as spectrum for it is released by the government, and will be in position to do field trials by the next year.

Jio also noted that its 4G network has been developed and deployed in a way that makes transition from 4G to 5G seamless and quick. The company says that once the 5G is ready for deployment in India, it will roll-out the Jio network at an accelerated pace.

Interestingly, Jio is saying that the technology powering its Jio network will be all made and created in India. For 5G networks, the underlying technology has become a complex issue because of companies Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei being industry leaders in it. This has prompted fears that using technology and equipment made by Chinese companies in critical infrastructure like telecom may undermine national security as well as privacy of users. This is an argument that many Western countries have taken as they have moved to bar Huawei and others from the 5G technology deployment. Just a few days ago, UK banned use of Huawei technology in 5G networks and ordered its removal from wherever it has been used so far by the end of the year.

India too is extremely cautious of technology and telecom gear supplied by Chinese companies.

"RIL chief Mukesh Ambani while addressing the AGM.

NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries on Wednesday said Jio has developed a Made-in-India 5G solution that can be ready for field deployment next year, and has teamed up with Google for developing affordable smartphones.

Asserting Jio's resolve to make India ""2G-mukt"" (free of 2G), RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani emphasised on the need to accelerate migration of 350 million Indians (currently using 2G feature phone) to an affordable smartphone, at a time when India stands at the doorsteps of the 5G era.

Ambani also announced Rs 33,737 crore investment by Google for a 7.7 per cent stake in Jio Platforms, and said Jio will partnering with the US tech giant to build an Android-based smartphone operating system.

Addressing RIL's 43rd AGM, Ambani said, ""There are many feature phone users who are waiting... to upgrade to a conventional smartphone...if only it were somehow more affordable. So, we have decided to address this challenge head-on. We believe we can design entry-level 4G... or even 5G smartphone...for a fraction of its current cost.""

However, powering such a smartphone, would require value-engineered smartphone operating system, one that is designed with India in mind, he emphasised.

""Through this partnership, we are confident that we can accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian. As India is standing at the doorsteps of the 5G era, we should accelerate the migration of 350 million Indians, who currently use a 2G feature phone, to an affordable smartphone,"" he said.

They should not be deprived of the benefits of the digital and data revolution, he added.

Outlining the company's 5G plans, Ambani said that Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch and that once this 5G solution is proven at India scale, Jio Platforms will be well-positioned to export it to other operators globally too, as a complete managed services.

""In the next three years, I can see a strong path for Jio to connect over half a billion mobile customers, over a billion smart sensors, and over 50 million homes and business establishments...,"" Ambani said.

Jio's 4G and fibre networks are powered by core software technology and components developed by Jio engineers in India, he said.

This capabilty and know-how positions Jio at the cutting-edge of exciting frontier of 5G technology.

""I have great pride in announcing that Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch. This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India using a 100 per cent homegrown technology and solution,"" he said.

This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available, and can be ready for field deployment next year.

""Because of Jio's converged all-IP network architecture, we can easily uprade our 4G network, to 5G,"" he said.

Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India scale, Jio Platforms will be well-positioned to be exporter of 5G solutions to other telcos globally.

""Jio platform is conceived with this vision of developing original, captive Intellectual Property, using which we can demonstrate transformative power of tech across multiple industry ecosytems. First, in India and then confidently offering these Made-in-India solutions to the rest of the world,"" he said.

Commenting on the new partnership, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said: ""Through this partnership with Jio Platforms, we see the chance to have an even greater impact than either company could have alone. This partnership is a key part of the next chapter of investment in India...Our investment of $4.5 billion in Jio is the first -- and the biggest -- investment we will make through this fund (of $10 billion announced on July 13)"".

Earlier this week, the company had announced its 'Google for India Digitisation Fund', wherein it will invest Rs 75,000 crore rupees (about $10 billion) to accelerate India's digital economy over the next 5-7 years.

""I am excited that our joint collaboration will focus on increasing access for hundreds of millions of Indians who don't currently own a smartphone, while improving the mobile experience for all...there is more work to do to connect every Indian to the opportunities that technology creates,"" Pichai said.

In a blogpost, Google said it has entered into a commercial agreement with Jio Platforms to jointly develop an entry-level affordable smartphone with optimisations to the Android operating system and the play store.

This effort will unlock new opportunities, further power the vibrant ecosystem of applications and push innovation to drive growth for the new Indian economy, it added.

Google said it wants to work with Jio and other leaders in the local ecosystem to ensure that smartphones - together with the apps and services in the Play Store - are within reach for many more Indians across the country.

""And we believe the pace of Indian innovation means that the experiences we create for India can ultimately be expanded to the rest of the world,"" the blogpost noted.

The global tech titan said India has been ""central"" to its Next Billion Users initiative that is designed to ensure the internet is useful for people coming online for the first time.

""In partnership (with Jio), we can draw on each other's strengths. We look forward to bringing smartphone access to more Indians - and exploring the many ways we can work together to improve Indians' lives and advance India's digital economy,"" the blog said.

"As major investments from tech giants stack up for India’s Jio Platforms, the chairman of parent Reliance Industries said a complete 5G solution created from scratch in-house by Jio can be ready for field deployments in 2021.

Speaking during Reliance’s Annual General Meeting on Wednesday, billionaire owner Mukesh Ambani laid out visions for its Jio Platforms unit, including plans to export 5G technologies to other telecom operators globally.

Jio Platforms is behind India’s largest mobile operator, which shook up the telecom market since entering the scene just four years ago – now counting more than 388 million subscribers. Ambani said he sees a strong path for Jio to connect over 500 million mobile customers, more than a billion smart sensors and over 50 million homes and business in the next three years.

With its 4G LTE-only network, Reliance Jio disrupted India’s telecom market that was largely 2G, offering very low pricing, broad coverage, and data. Some of India’s numerous operators at the time were forced to exit or decided to consolidate, leaving three major players – Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio.

According to GSMA’s Mobile Economy 2020 report (PDF), the resulting price war following Jio’s entry has meant India now has some of the cheapest mobile data pricing in the world, while 4G now accounts for almost 60% of total connections in the country.

Jio Platforms has secured billions in investments, including Google which said yesterday it would put $4.5 billion into the company for a 7.7% share. Facebook is investing $5.7 billion for just under 10% in Jio Platforms. Other investors include Intel Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, private-equity firms Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, and General Atlantic, and Abu Dhabi’s two largest sovereign investment arms.

Ambani said the operator’s 4G and fiber network is already powered by several core software technologies and components developed by Jio engineers in India.

“This capability and know-how that Jio has developed positions Jio on the cutting edge of another exciting frontier – 5G,” Ambani said. The in-house 5G solution “will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India using 100% home-grown technologies and solutions.”

News of Jio developing end-to-end 5G technology to replace third-party vendors previously surfaced in March. During the AGM, Reliance referenced a 5G stack built by Jio employees.

In a post about Jio's latest strategic partnerships and fundraising blitz (more than $20 billion in eight weeks), Counterpoint Research VP of Research Neil Shah pointed to Reliance Industries' earlier acquisition of Radisys in regards to the network software stack.

""With 5G around the corner, Jio can lay out a fully-controlled greenfield network to build the software stack via Radisys in fixed as well as wireless networks,"" wrote Shah. ""It remains to be seen if there are any other big moves on the Radio Access Network (RAN) hardware side or it will depend on the long-term partner Samsung.""

Speaking at Reliance's AGM, Ambani said Jio's 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum becomes available and ready for field deployments in 2021.

Jio can easily upgrade its 4G network to 5G, he told investors, citing the converged all-IP network architecture. And Jio has sights beyond India for its 5G tech.

“Once Jio’s 5G solution is proven in India, Jio Platforms will be well positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally as a complete managed service,” Ambani said.

Affordable smartphones with Google

Google’s involvement with Jio also includes a commercial agreement to jointly develop an affordable 4G smartphone.

Part of Jio’s impact in connecting mobile users in India was the introduction of low-cost feature phone with 4G connectivity. The JioPhone launched in August of 2017 and sold over 100 million devices, costing less than $10.

In 2019, India surpassed the U.S. as the second-largest smartphone market globally with 158 million shipments and is still under penetrated relative to many markets, according to Counterpoint Research. By 2025 India will still be the second largest smartphone market with 1.04 billion users, only behind China, according to the GSMA.

Still, Ambani in his presentation said there are 350 million Indians who currently use a 2G feature phone that would want to upgrade to a conventional smartphone if it was affordable.

“We believe we can design an entry-level 4G, or even a 5G, smartphone for a fraction of its current cost,” Ambani said.

To that end, it's partnering with Google to build an Android-based smartphone operating system, designed with India in mind.

“Through this partnership we are confident that we can accelerate the national mission of putting a smart device in the hands of every Indian,” he said, adding that existing 2G users shouldn’t be deprived of the benefits that the digital and data revolution offer. “Jio is determined to make India 2G-mukt.”

Google’s investment in Jio is the first part of a $10 billion Google for India Digitization Fund announced earlier this week. It aims to help accelerate India’s digital economy by making strategic investments in the country over the next 5-7 years.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a video appearance said “getting technology into the hands of more people is a big part of our mission,” and Google through its partnership with Jio Platforms sees a chance to have a greater impact than either entity could alone.

Pichai said he was excited the joint collaboration would focus on increasing access for hundreds of millions of Indians who don’t currently own a smartphone, while simultaneously improving the mobile experience for all.

"In the year 2012, a quarterly video conference of executives of the largest private sector company of India commenced with a word of caution. The Chairman of the company said “What has brought us here will not take us to the future.” Due to mounting global trade tautness and strong push for renewable energy he was fretful that the company’s bastion business of crude oil refining and petrochemicals could lose polish. Although his father, the founder of the entity, wanted to compete with the success of international energy super titans, son was quick to comprehend that ‘Data is the new oil’ and began the inexorable revolution of the company. Yes, he is none other than Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman of the largest private sector company of India, Reliance Industries Limited.



Ambani had planned to acquire Infotel Broadband Limited in 2010. However, daughter Isha’s criticism when she was home from Yale University for a holiday, about pathetic broadband speeds in India gave birth to revolutionary wave in his mind and connected the dots. Ambani swiftly realized that digital technology is the newfangled superhighway to mammoth accomplishment and took approximately four years to launch Reliance Jio in September 2016. At present, it is India’s hugest network with round about 40 crore 4G subscribers. It has become Reliance’s evolution engine, blending with the entity’s fast-growing retail arm to help in counterbalancing the decrease in oil and petrochemicals. Jio has built world-class capabilities in technologies such as 4G, Cloud computing, Devices and OS, Big Data, AI, AR/VR, Blockchain, Natural Language Understanding and Computer Vision.



Ambani did not fail to groom his children. In 2014 his twin children, Isha and Akash, joined Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail boards and look after the corporate office in Mumbai’s Reliance Corporate Park. Many know that he gave only four days break to elder son Akash after his graduation to join the organization. A little late, the youngest son, Anant joined the gang. Akash crowns strategy and leads procurements along with Isha, who is part and parcel of branding and marketing.



As many know Ambani is well known for disrupting the numerous business sectors or models. Four years ago, in 2016, when he proposed 4G Volte smartphones under Reliance’s own brand name Lyf at an attractive and economical price of Rs.2,999 tremendous skepticism flowed through the eavesdroppers at Reliance’s annual general meeting. Of late, during company’s first virtual annual general meeting Ambani charted another visualization to disrupt the mobile marketplace again.



Ambani is working from home

Ambani threw his hat into the ring and announced Reliance to be a contender with its own 5G network solution. Having invented a remedy from scratch, he is in a mood to crack now. With this technological change of building a virtualized 5G network, existing hardware dependent networks can be budged to software centric podiums. This will also significantly reduce the network costs. According to software entity Mavenir, 40 per cent saving can be done in capex and 34 per cent saving can be done in operational costs due to new virtualized networks.



Reliance placidly started work of building Generation Z network in 2018 by acquiring US-based Radisys. Reliance through its subsidiary company Rancore Technologies which is now amalgamated with Jio, was crafting its telecom Research and Development design. Few months ago, it has also pursued the Central government to grant permission for 5G trials.



Now Google said hum saath saath hain and showed interest to invest in Jio Platforms. Numerous plans have been drafted by both Relaince and Google to make India ‘2G mukt.’ Like cherry on cake, many international players such as Facebook, Silver Lake partners, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, TPG, LCatterton, PIF, Intel and Qualcomm have joined the Reliance as investors and strategic partners. Altogether Jio has raised Rs.152,055.45 crore from these fabulous fourteen financial partners. Majority of them are part of the Open RAN Policy Coalition which was set up in May 2020 to support 5G technology. Reliance is also a member of the coalition and Ambani lucidly mentioned that 5G network is ready for experiments once spectrum is made accessible.



Poor signal

Although with the billions of dollars he has raised working from home, the richest man of India decided to step into the infringement shaped by the technology cold war, his plan of designing 5G network does not show vibrant signal. To large extent it is a foolhardy plan. His speech sprinkled with many customary catchwords including dedication of 5G solutions to Prime Minister of India’s Atmanirbhar vision is short on substance or gist. He also called the technology a “Huwai-killer” and mentioned that US State Secretary Mike Pompeo proclaimed Jio for not using the Chinese flavor.



Launching of 5G is not a child’s play. It is very expensive and roll out of 4G has disclosed it. Again, 5G cannot be launched at one shot. Like many operators across the world introduced 4G in a phased style, the strategy for the 5G venture should be the same. Premium consumers should be aimed first.



More momentously, the plan of creation of network infrastructure to facilitate large-scale networks to function in mission-critical mode on a real-time basis is absent. Also, the strategies to manage traffic patterns, pollution levels, electricity grids are vague. In addition, Huawei of China hold the most patents in the world and many Chinese and Korean companies have already control the largest number of such patents. Numerous entities including Samsung have commenced the task on 5G technology long ago. This is why Ambani’s plan of action looks cynical.



British telecom companies have been granted seven years from now to rip out Huawei equipment from their networks. Prolong time has been granted by Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of United Kingdom considering the capital costs of shorter duration and probable blackout throughout their networks. Therefore, for a telecom company with only four year track record and with no substantial patents, establishment of complete home-grown 5G network is a gargantuan task.



Although Ambani and his friends who are Indian policymakers are ambitious about the new venture, overall infrastructure is not supportive. Everyone is hoping for fiscal sops from the government. Operators in India are doubtful to buy their network from an entity which is a rival in services. Furthermore, there is a lesson for Reliance. The biggest operator in the United States of America, Verizon, promised high speed data to its consumers and eventually failed in the compliance with the standards laid down. Later, the company adopted a lower technology norm which is not comprehensive 5G network.



Plan of launching 5G network by the Japanese E-commerce player Rakuten is already the news. Though it is the good news that the virtualized network is the reality, Reliance will face tough challenge from Rakuten. The said Japanese company is already ahead in the battle and approached Dish Wireless to sell its mobile network in the United States of America. Surprisingly, key person who played a vital role in Jio’s 5G network business blueprint joined Rakuten as chief technology officer.



To conclude, in the 5G world, telecom operators need to step outside the zone of connectivity and team up with manifold patrons across sectors namely finance, transport, retail and healthcare to deliver groundbreaking digital services and amenities. More importantly, in 5G the value chain is very complex and multifarious. Even though, Jio took big leap and approached the Department of Telecommunications for assigning 5G spectrum, the government’s imminent auction process might be limited to only 4G spectrum. While ambitious Ambani who went past the government’s retirement age of 60 three years before, is confident of selling 5G technology in global markets like the US, Australia, Japan, Europe and the UK and sure of making India self-reliant, many questions of approximately 6 lakh people across 473 cities in 41 countries who watched Reliance Industries’ 43rd virtual annual general meeting, remain unanswered. Instead of big ticket announcements and lofty claims the richest man of India has to invent rich measures to make 5G India. Only then he can say cheers with Jio Glass. Elsewise India will forever remain as Dream 5G India.

"Reliance Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology, according to sources. The company’s wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies.

According to sources, Reliance Jio on July 17 requested for 800 megahertz of frequencies in the 26 gigahertz (Ghz) and 24 Ghz band as well as 100 Mhz in 3.5 GHz band for running field trials in “urban centres like Delhi and Mumbai”.

“Jio has said that high frequencies has been put to use in advance countries like the US, South Korea, Japan, Canada, the UK. They also want trails in these bands should start in India to make India “Aatmanirbhar”. Government is open to the suggestion and trials. Already many trials are going on,” an official source said.

The company has sought spectrum frequencies between 26.5 – 29.5 Ghz and 24.25-27.5 Ghz band. The auction for these high frequency bands is expected to be held next year. UN body International Telecommunication Union approved 5G standards for 26 gigahertz band in November last year while the standards for other bands are yet to be decided.

In its pitch for starting trials in higher spectrum band, Jio in the letter has said that the US, South Korea, Japan etc have started working in 28 Ghz band and some other countries in 26 Ghz band and therefore it wants to run trials of its 5G technology before selling it abroad.

In the 43rd annual general meeting, Reliance Industries Limited Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said that Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch. “This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India using 100% home grown technologies and solutions. This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available and can be ready for field deployment next year,” Ambani had said.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Financial Express,Reliance Jio seeks spectrum for 5G trials,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/mukesh-ambani-reliance-jio-seeks-spectrum-for-5g-trials-plans-to-sell-tech-overseas/2030017/lite/
"“Digital commerce and all other areas of technological collaboration will continue to grow between India and the US,” she added.

In what may be another sign of growing convergence in ties between India and the United States, both countries are likely to become partners on 5G internet network development. The statement was made by US India Business Council (USIBC) President Nisha Biswal in her comments to news agency ANI. Biswal also said that the technology sector was an important area of collaboration between the United States and India.

“I think that both the countries will become partners on 5G internet technology and create the adequate digital infrastructure for the future,” Biswal told ANI. “Digital commerce and all other areas of technological collaboration will continue to grow between India and the US,” she added.

Terming the relationship between the two countries trusted she said that since both the countries have a large digital savvy population, the collaboration on the issue of internet and technology is bound to grow between the two countries. She also said that the Coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the global supply chains on a massive level and recent developments will further strengthen the relationship between the two countries. She also said that the supply chain of the pharmaceutical sector was also one of the affected areas.

On the issue of the development of Coronavirus vaccine, Biswal said that the countries are also looking at collaboration on the issue of the research of vaccine and other treatment options.

"Canadian quantum computing company D-Wave Systems is launching its cloud service in India, giving developers and researchers in the country real-time access to its quantum computers.

Through this geographic expansion, D-Wave’s 2000Q quantum computers, hybrid solvers and the application environment can be used via its cloud platform Leap to drive development of business-critical and in-production hybrid applications.

“Quantum computing is poised to fundamentally transform the way businesses solve critical problems, leading to new efficiencies and profound business value in industries like transportation, finance, pharmaceuticals and much more,” Murray Thom, VP of Software and Services at D-Wave, said in a statement.

“The future of quantum computing is in the cloud. That’s why we were eager to expand Leap to India and Australia, where vibrant tech scenes will have access to real-time quantum computers and the hybrid solver service for the first time, unlocking new opportunities across industries.”

As part of this rollout, users in India and Australia can work on the D-Wave’s Leap and Leap 2 platforms.

The two cloud platforms offer updated features and tools, including hybrid solver service that can solve large and complex problems of up to 10,000 variables; and integrated developer environment that has a prebuilt, ready-to-code environment in the cloud configured with the latest Ocean SDK for quantum hybrid development in Python.

D-Wave’s systems and software have been used in financial modelling, machine learning and route optimization.

Its latest launch in India comes about a year after the country’s Department of Science and Technology (DST) chalked out plans to build its own quantum computers.

In early 2019, DST launched a programme focused on quantum computing, called Quantum-Enabled Science and Technology (QuEST). As part of QuEST, India earmarked ₹80 crore investment to be spent over a span of three years to facilitate research in setting up quantum computers.

A year later, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Union Budget 2020 Speech, announced a National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications (NM-QTA) with an outlay of ₹8,000 crore for the next five years.

“Quantum technology is opening up new frontiers in computing, communications, cyber security with wide-spread applications,” Sitharaman said in her Budget Speech.

“It is expected that lots of commercial applications would emerge from theoretical constructs which are developing in this area.”

NM-QTA’s focus, as outlined by the minister, will be in fundamental science, translation, technology development and, human and infrastructural resource generation.

Other areas of quantum computing applications will include aero-space engineering, numerical weather prediction, simulations, securing communication and financial transactions, cyber-security, and advanced manufacturing.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",The Hindu,D-Wave’s quantum computing cloud comes to India,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/d-waves-quantum-computing-cloud-comes-to-india/article32145904.ece
"India’s largest technology firms have had a surprisingly good pandemic. Infosys posted a sequential growth in revenue in rupee terms, buoyed by new large deals, and outperformed its peers for the second successive quarter. TCS, HCL Technologies and Wipro saw a sequential decline due to pandemic-related disruption, but all four reported operating profits ahead of the street’s expectations. In an interview to this newspaper, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh expressed confidence in going digital and cloud computing. When one company in any sector goes digital, others have to follow, just to stay in the reckoning. That means plenty of work for the IT industry as a whole. Overall, the prospects of India’s IT firms look bright, provided these companies move up the technology ladder swiftly because artificial intelligence will automate many kinds of work they perform.

These companies have been preparing, to varying degrees, for their own digital transformation and greater automation. More skilling, inorganic growth through acquisitions, an increase in the R&D spend to be better prepared for the pace of technology change, investing in startups and working closely with marquee clients on large projects in sectors that range from BFSI to manufacturing were considered blue-prints to stay afloat. This could be a challenge in the long run. Before artificial intelligence eats their lunch, Indian IT companies must themselves deploy artificial intelligence in their offerings. They have to alter their hiring, nurture and reskill talent internally and motivate people to develop and acquire new skills.

Digital transformation, the cloud, data analytics and the Internet of Things offer huge opportunities. The industry needs new skills and new ways of doing things so that companies can shift gears to higher productivity. Machine learning involves a lot of human labour, to begin with. Once that stage is over, machines and their algorithms can displace a whole lot of middling human skills. So, software engineers might need to learn new skills and unlearn old ones, to grab new opportunities.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Economic Times,Huge revenue growth if Indian IT grows,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/et-editorials/huge-revenue-growth-if-indian-it-grows/
"Great time to invest in India: PM Modi tells IBM CEO

India

pti-Madhuri Adnal

New Delhi, July 20: This is a great time to invest in India and the country is welcoming investments in the tech sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told IBM CEO Arvind Krishna on Monday.

In a virtual interaction with Krishna, the prime minister noted that while the world is witnessing a slowdown, FDI inflow in India is increasing. Modi said the country is moving forward with the vision of a self-sufficient India so that a globally competent and disruption resilient local supply chain can be developed, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office.

Talking about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business culture, the prime minister said 'work from home' is being adopted in a big way and the government is constantly working towards providing infrastructure, connectivity and regulatory environment to ensure that this technological shift is smooth.

Modi also discussed the technologies associated and challenges involved in the recent decision of IBM to make 75 per cent of its employees to work from home, the statement said.

The IBM CEO briefed the prime minister about his company's huge investment plans in India and expressed confidence in the vision of an 'Aatma nirbhar Bharat' (a self-reliant India), the statement said.

""The prime minister highlighted that this is a great time to invest in India. He said the country is welcoming and supporting investments taking place in the tech sector. He noted that while the world is witnessing slowdown, FDI inflow in India is increasing,"" the statement said.

In the course of interaction, Modi explored the possibilities of creating India-specific artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools in the healthcare sector and development of better models for disease prediction and analysis. He underlined that the country is moving towards developing an integrated, tech and data-driven healthcare system which is affordable and hassle-free for the people.

Modi noted that IBM can play an important role in taking forward the healthcare vision. Krishna appreciated the prime minister's vision for Ayushman Bharat (the all-India healthcare scheme) and talked about using technology for early identification of diseases. Modi appreciated the role played by IBM, in association with CBSE, towards launching of AI curriculum in 200 schools in India. He said the government is working towards introducing students to concepts such as AI and machine learning at an early stage, to further the tech temperament in the country. Krishna said teaching about technology and data should be in the category of basic skills like algebra, which needs to be taught with passion, and should be introduced early.

Other areas of discussion included the issues of data security, cyber attacks, concerns around privacy and health benefits of yoga. Modi also congratulated Krishna on becoming the global head of IBM earlier this year. He mentioned the strong connection of IBM with India and its huge presence in the country, with over one lakh people working across 20 cities in the company.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Oneindia,Great time to invest in India: PM Modi tells IBM CEO,https://www.oneindia.com/india/great-time-to-invest-in-india-pm-modi-tells-ibm-ceo-3122452.html
"As the world grapples with a new way of life and the COVID-19 crisis peaks, its impact on everyone’s mental and physical health is indescribable.





The pandemic is not only creating a major impact on the global economy, it is also helping to accelerate the development and commercialisation of several emerging technologies that previously received lukewarm consumer response. This is predominantly accurate for innovations that reduce human-to-human contact, automate processes, and increase productivity amid social distancing.









With Artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) rapidly gaining ground in varying forms and degrees, the use of these innovation has begun to appear in a wide spectrum of technologies - from the phones we use to communicate to the supply chains that bring goods to market. It is modifying the way we interact, consume information, and obtain goods and services.





Healthcare is no exception to this new disruption. In the medical industry, the impact of AI, IoT, and other technologies through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), is transforming care delivery.





Data suggests that AI simplifies the lives of patients, doctors, and hospital administrators by performing tasks that are typically done by humans, but in less time and at a fraction of the cost.





It allows patients to track their ultrasounds, thermometers, glucose monitors, electrocardiograms, etc., by being connected through technologies like AI and IoT. These are reinventing and reinvigorating modern healthcare through machines that can predict, comprehend, learn, and act.





A major trend in medicine, when it comes to AI, is using deep learning in medical diagnosis to detect cancer. A recent study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute shows that the AI system has achieved a breast cancer detection accuracy comparable to an average breast radiologist.





With the ability of AI networks to train radiologists, there are chances that their performance will be significantly improved in the nearest future.





Another promising implementation is the use of AI and the Internet of Medical Things in consumer health applications, which allows them to gather healthcare data and process the information and offer adjustments to the current lifestyle of a patient.





Its major purpose is to improve the hospital room experience and simplify the process of preparing patients to continue their healing at home. Also, virtual nurses reduce patient anxiety, improve safety, keep people entertained, and increase patient satisfaction with medical services.





When it comes to medical diagnosis, doctors have seen that applying AI & IoT to medical diagnosis provides numerous benefits to the healthcare industry. AI and IoT based software can tell whether a patient has a certain disease even before evident symptoms appear.





But what AI is extensively helping doctors in is the ease that it is providing in classifying diseases. With deep learning technologies that analyse images and recognise patterns, it is creating a huge potential in generating algorithms that are helping healthcare officials in diagnosing diseases faster.





Moreover, research suggests that AI-driven software can be programmed to accurately spot signs of a certain disease in medical images such as MRIs, X-rays, and CT scans. Existing similar solutions already use AI for cancer diagnosis by processing photos of skin lesions.





By using such tools, doctors are able to diagnose patients more accurately and prescribe the most suitable treatment for them at an earlier stage, resulting in increasing the chances of cancer prevention.





Henceforth, we can say that from patient and self-service to chatbots, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for diagnosis, and image data analysis to identify candidate molecules in drug discovery, AI, IoT and other technologies are already at work.





They are swiftly helping in increasing convenience and efficiency, reducing costs and errors, and generally making it easier for more patients to receive the healthcare they need. While each technology can contribute significant value alone, the larger potential lies in the synergies generated by using them together across the entire patient journey, from diagnoses to treatment, to ongoing health maintenance.

It can easily be said that AI and IoT solutions can lead to better care outcomes and improve the productivity and efficiency of care delivery. They can also improve the day-to-day life of healthcare practitioners, letting them spend more time looking after patients, and in doing so, raise staff morale and improve retention.





It can even offer life-saving treatments to markets faster. With the increased use of AI and IoT in healthcare, it will certainly influence the types of new entrants into the healthcare industry as well as influence how providers, clinicians, and other staff will work in the future.





In India, the last five years have seen consumer-facing ‘health tech’ being talked about and embraced by investors, government, and gradually by the public. Among educated consumers in urban areas, technology is largely gaining traction through online health service aggregators, telemedicine, e-pharmacies, and a few fitness apps. Existing methods are also being used to reinvent healthcare delivery in the form of online consults or chat-based basic healthcare service apps, especially during these unprecedented times.





From a social viewpoint, building greater trust in AI and protecting personal healthcare data will continue to be among the universal challenges. From an administrative standpoint, making it easier for AI to integrate with existing technology infrastructure will certainly help adoption.





For our country, we can conclude that these advanced technologies in healthcare are helping expand the human capacity rather than replacing human labour altogether. Putting us in a unique position to be the driver for AI and IoT technologies in healthcare space for national and international companies.





With large amounts of data and a burgeoning startup community, India has the opportunity to address many healthcare-related problems by using them. With new disruptions in healthcare innovations, we will soon be in a position to realise the benefits of these technologies on health outcomes.





Irrespective of a patient’s location or condition, an evolution of the AI, IoT, IoMT ecosystem will become progressively impactful. And even the most remote locations will benefit from better access to care as connected medical devices continue to find their way into the hands of both patients and clinicians.





Connected health and Artificial intelligence in healthcare is no more a thing of the future, it is slowly transforming the ‘now’ that we are living in.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",YourStory.com,Here’s how connected health and artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare industry,https://yourstory.com/2020/07/connected-health-artificial-intelligence-healthcare-industry
"The rapid spread of coronavirus and the mounting fatalities has spurred research worldwide to contain the deadly disease. India, which has breached the one million mark in cases and 25,000 in deaths, is also investing heavily in covid-19 research and exploring ways of using science and technology to fight the contagion. Ashutosh Sharma, secretary at ministry of science and technology, spoke about the covid-19 pandemic, the government’s multipronged approach to deal with the health crisis, mathematical models, the role of science and technology in the government’s ambitious “Atmanirbhar Bharat"" or self-reliant India campaign, and the way forward. Edited excerpts from an interview:

The covid-19 pandemic is evolving continuously. What is the situation in India, where the number of cases has crossed 1 million and deaths have crossed 25,000?

Covid-19, which is caused by SARS CoV-2 virus, is a multidimensional problem. Little is known about the behaviour of this virus and its transmission. The world over, communities are still researching it. While there is now partial clarity about the pathways of its transmission, its impact on different organs, persistence of antibodies generated by the body against the virus, its virulence and mutations over time remain important questions. Projects are being supported to study all this. The department of science and technology (DST) opened multiple fronts to combat covid-19. We are strengthening basic research in pathways of transmission of the virus, its mechanisms of action, repurposing of the drugs and the search for vaccines. We do have challenges. We have more densely populated cities, which helps the spread of infection.

However, considering its large population, India has indeed managed the covid-19 situation with a mix of strategies better than even many developed countries. We are into a new normal as we cannot shut down our livelihood options. Gradually, we have ramped up testing, which is one of the reasons we are getting more cases. With more testing, we are able to catch infections early and treat those infected, which is why we have a low death rate and a high recovery rate. We should not look at the absolute numbers, which are proportional to population, but at indicators such as the percentages of infected and recovered populations, doubling time, severity of cases and fatalities, and others, which provide a holistic picture of the effective interventions required.

What is the ministry of science and technology doing to address the research and development, and innovation-related challenges arising out of the pandemic?

We have expedited and simplified the processes to help the country’s fight against the covid-19 pandemic. In addition to basic science projects, a mapping of startups that were ready with relevant products and technologies for covid-19 was done. More than 60 startups were selected to receive seed funding to speedily develop their products and commercialize them. The basket of products includes ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPEs), masks, disinfecting systems, diagnostics, and a vaccine company. Similarly, industries that had demonstrated indigenous products were supported in scaling up to required quantities.

About 30 mid-sized NGOs have been empowered to disseminate critical information on covid-19. The latest developments on covid-19 are being propagated through a 10-20 minute bulletin every day for past three months. These are placed on an internet-based TV channel, “India Science"". An interactive booklet called “Covid Katha"" has also been published in several languages, which even children can understand.

How reliable are the mathematical models for covid-19 protection that your ministry is working on and can they help fight coronavirus?

Mathematical models and simulations are of vital importance in predicting the course of a disease and its possible impact on resources. Models can be of immense use in planning and decision making. At our ministry, a super group of more than 10 modelling sub-groups in the country was created to cooperatively evolve a supermodel that is robust and enjoys the trust of a large number of scientists working in this area.

The first version of our supermodel is expected to be put up for scrutiny in 15 days. The models are constantly updated with the latest data, practices and policies on local zoning and distancing measures. Modeling of pandemics serves much the same purpose as war games. Models can be used to fine-tune our strategies and for chalking out optimal paths. While models are not always robust in predicting absolute numbers, they can predict the relative impact and effectiveness of different interventions, such as relaxation of lockdowns in certain areas with certain density of patients or population. The impact of interventions is best judged in trends and percentages, rather than in absolute numbers.

How can artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) be used in bringing diagnostic solutions for covid-19?

Another group under this ministry is creating improved, and inexpensive methods of covid-19 diagnosis using AI and ML, which can also be applied along with telemedicine. AI is also being used to hunt for repurposed drugs.

Repurposing existing infrastructure is another creative method to fight covid-19. One such example is the use of RT-PCR machines that were previously meant for research in other areas. The Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleo-Sciences in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, which has the capacity to study fossilized DNA, is now repurposed to conduct 500 covid tests every day. We are also researching the lifestyles related to boosting of immunity, strengthening lungs, and stress reduction, all of which are relevant to covid-19.

A new programme is scientifically exploring the yoga and meditation practices that may help in these directions. It is also important to understand the problems that people at large face and their possible solutions by reaching out to a large number of people in smaller towns and villages. The National Innovation Foundation in Ahmedabad has been engaged in one such exercise.

How are you ensuring that scientifically made innovative products and technologies can easily penetrate the market?

It is vital that the products and technologies that are evolving should have market access in the time of the pandemic. There have been several government initiatives in this direction. One is the preference for Indian companies where global tenders need not be placed for orders of less than ₹200 crore. Several other initiatives to help market access of startups and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have also been put in place by the government.

We have to learn, remember, and implement several key lessons while going forward to develop global-quality products with speed and scale. There is a reworking of the processes of support by various ministries to bring in ease of doing business and by cooperation between different stakeholders from the beginning.

Academia, research and development laboratories, industry and startups working together with a shared, clear and present purpose provides an early direction. This produces a seamless pipeline from basic and applied research and development to design to prototype to startups, industry and society. The key in all of this is an effective matching of knowledge producing systems with knowledge consumption systems.

The pandemic has stretched our healthcare system beyond capacities and the country is striving to improve on health infrastructure. Your take?

Despite all constraints, India is working on becoming atma nirbhar (self-sufficient) by engaging, leveraging, and building on our strengths, which are substantial.

Several varieties of innovative ventilators were produced within two months, which were earlier imported at twice the cost or more. Such examples can be found in the entire system from diagnostics to disinfectants, masks to PPEs.

Laboratories of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Indian Council of Medical Research, the department of biotechnology, the department of science and technology, and the Indian Institutes of Technology have produced many technology products and solutions within a short time by the power of cooperation and purpose. I am sure that these successes will also be replicated in our ongoing hunt for vaccines and repurposed drugs. For vaccines, our scientists are working extraordinarily hard to shrink the usual timelines.

All of these lessons for speedy development of relevant technologies will help our industry not only regain but do better than their pre-covid performances.

"As one of the world’s fastest growing economies in the recent decade, India owes its successful and sustained growth largely to the robustness and strength of the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector.





India’s SME sector accounts for 45 percent of industrial output, and 40 percent of the total exports in India, generating employment for 60 million people and creating 1.3 million new jobs annually.





The SME sector has also emerged as a key factor to urbanise rural India and bring entire generations of professionals into the workforce.





Given the scale of the SME sector, it is no surprise that talent acquisition and recruiting remains one of the most complex and inefficient processes.





At the same time, the last decade has seen the emergence of startups using technology to simplify recruitment. With Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms, using these new solutions is simple and quick.





Discovering and hiring the right talent still remains the single-most important factor determining the success of businesses, and SMEs are no different. In situations where SMEs may not have dedicated HR teams or budgets to hire recruitment agencies, recruitment platforms provide a cost-effective solution to hiring at scale.





Here are some benefits of recruiting platforms which outperform traditional recruiting.

Sourcing

With online recruitment platforms, there is no limit to the reach or size of audience that a company can aim to reach. Most online platforms build large pipelines of active candidates from multiple sources (online, offline) and allow companies the flexibility of searching and filtering these candidates based on specific criteria (salary bracket, years of experience, location...etc.).





With access to lakhs of potential hires, companies can be very focussed on targeting the candidates who are most likely to fit their given role.

Evaluation and matching

While CVs remain important in organised industries, many in the unorganised workforce rely on direct interviews or referrals to evaluate and match applicants. Since skills and experience are essentially claimed information, initial shortlisting requires a lot more effort to identify and match the right candidates.





Machine learning algorithms can transform your shortlist from 100 good candidates to 10 great ones based on learning from millions of data points.





Soft skills

Over the past decade, people have become increasingly comfortable with video and this is soon becoming a simple way to assess simple communication skills. We can use video to optimally pre-assess a candidate’s presentation and communication skills.





We simply ask them to record a short 60 second video describing their backgrounds and achievements. This way, recruiters do not need to wait until the first interview to judge soft skills.

Role specific screening questions

Every role has specific tasks and requirements that derive from a candidate's past work experience. Specifics matter especially when it comes to more specific industries or functions. To simplify the process for recruiters, many recruiting platforms have introduced simple ways to screen candidates.





We can use a mix of online questions and chat-based interfaces to gather the exact information we need at the right time.





Assessments

It is common practice for companies to request candidates to perform specific assignments or assessments to ensure they are practically capable of solving real-life challenges. However, creating large banks of questions requires time and subject matter expertise, which may be challenging for SMEs.





Recruitment platforms could provide these services. Candidate assessment results are a significant part of the evaluation as they provide the proof of the claimed skills being accurate or not.

Finally, with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, virtual hiring is the new normal. It is more important than ever to understand all important aspects of a candidate in time for the first video interview. Virtual interviewing has its positives, but a major drawback is the inability to truly express oneself.





Therefore, it is critical to spend the time interviewing only the most relevant and qualified candidates (based on the mentioned parameters) and conducting a more pointed and detail oriented session.





SMEs can benefit just like the big players do from intelligent talent recruitment platforms. Ultimately, it is about solving challenges related to efficiency and scalability. Machine learning technologies provide us with solutions that companies of any size can benefit from.





As India’s SME sector continues to grow and attract the best talent, recruitment platforms will hopefully help continue to contribute to the recovery of India’s economy post-COVID.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",YourStory.com,How recruitment platforms are set to drive the expansion and growth of SME sector in India,https://yourstory.com/2020/07/recruitment-platforms-expansion-growth-sme-sector-india
"In metro cities, families living in societies or apartment complexes will face a challenge of charging at their homes due to common meter connection of basements or ground floors with other neighbours.

The automobile industry the world over is slowly creeping back to normalcy as countries get used to the ‘new normal’ and perhaps some would push ahead with their plans to buy a new car, which would also translate to a safety measure against the spread of the coronavirus outbreak (avoiding public transport). An opinion floats that the focus of electric mobility could gain momentum in the post-COVID era. But before we get there, a sturdy network of charging stations is crucial if we want to electrify our four-wheelers.

There are several challenges to installing charging stations in public spaces and homes. We spoke with EVI Technologies to learn about how can these be overcome. We also discuss India’s future as an EV manufacturing hub and is Union Minister Nitin Gadkari’s claim on the subject a viable ambition and what will it take for India to be self-reliant in EV manufacturing. In conversation: Rupesh Kumar, CEO, EVI Technologies.

(L to R) Rupesh Kumar, Aditya Raj Verma, Vikrant K Aggarwal, co-founders, EVI Technologies

1) A brief background on EVI Technologies Pvt Ltd and its ventures

EVI Technologies Private Limited (EVIT) is India’s fastest growing EV charging solutions Infrastructure Company based in New Delhi. The company was founded in 2017 and incubated by Electropreneur Park (funded & Supported by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), GoI). We offer end to end E-mobility solutions of highest quality standards with sustainable, reliable and consistent performance. We provide both EV AC (slow) and DC (fast) chargers that work through the user authentication process via a mobile app on the user/operator side.

Our products are designed & developed by integrating efficient and robust power technologies with advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (machine learning) based algorithm thus enabling a perfect product to cater to the market. EV charging solutions are complete indigenous development of EVIT team with flexibility and compatibility as per market demand and complying with global standards.

2) Is the presence of a denser charging network the solution to range anxiety? What are the challenges in setting up chargers in individual homes or societies?

Range anxiety is a fear that is very evident amongst EV consumers and while dense charging network leads to less waiting time for an EV driver and eases the concern of driving EVs, for dense networks to work we have to overcome a lot of challenges. The primary problem we face is the availability of land for easy access of EV chargers to drivers especially commercial vehicles.

Secondly, in metro cities, families living in societies or apartment complexes will face a challenge of charging at their homes due to common meter connection of basements or ground floors with other neighbours but we believe all these are transitional challenges and adoption of EVs is inevitable, only proper policy and decision making will make it in a faster way.

3) Does battery life deteriorate quicker under fast charging?

Yes, Lithium Battery is highly sensitive to temperature and operating conditions, so its charging and discharging rates care with temperature and with fast charging lead to a reduction in the life cycle of Lithium Batteries.

4) Is lithium-ion the only way forward for EV batteries? Are there any other viable battery types like sodium-ion that can be developed and ease the pressure on the import of lithium-ion cells?

We are living in a world which is very dynamic, nothing is permanent. We are growing and evolving constantly with newer and more advanced technologies coming up every other day. With so many companies trying to find the most sustainable power and charging solution we can be sure that the world will definitely see an alternative battery charging solution soon. We believe in the next few years we will get a lot of other chemistries in this E-Mobility sector, batteries like graphene batteries, aluminium with water batteries, etc are being developed across the world.

In India, the government aims to make the country a hundred percent EV nation, while the achievability of this target is questionable the main idea is to reduce oil imports in the country. We don’t want to reduce oil imports just to increase lithium imports. Our country is rich in many mineral ores and we believe that we can find a viable charging solution from the ample resources available in our country within the next few years.

5) The automobile industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, but even so, an opinion floats that EVs will catch on in the post-COVID era due to their environmental benefits. Do you agree?

The pandemic has shaken every industry across the board, the EV industry is no exception but talks about environmental deterioration and climate change has been a hot topic well before the pandemic. The pandemic has shown people a considerable change in air quality during the lockdown period due to reduced emissions and air pollution. This could be our silver lining. The lockdown has increased awareness of the importance of reducing carbon emissions and may push people to choose a more environmentally friendly as well as sustainable technology once the situation settles down. We believe that after the situation becomes normal people will start spending on environment-friendly technologies including EVs but still we have to see what option as industry players we are giving to our customers.

Also considering the current India-China tussle, and India’s dependency on China for different components and other parts, partnerships among the industry players to create and sell complete eco-system to end customers can be a major milestone in selling the EV products with Made in India tag.

6) Union Minister Nitin Gadkari recently stated that India can be a global EV manufacturing hub within the next five years. Would you agree, considering that India does not manufacture battery cells and the Indian automobile industry is at present substantially dependent on China for component imports?

We would like to believe it is achievable within 5 years however this is only possible if we focus on innovation, particularly in battery technology.

As of now, the battery cells (Li) are sourced from China and more than 70% of the market depends on China for the use of batteries in EV segment.

EV manufacturing industry needs these three primary things in place before we can call India a manufacturing hub

o Policy for EV manufacturing and allied components like batteries, chargers etc: Not only batteries but EV allied components must be in-house only then can we achieve this goal. There are other major components in EVs like Motor, controller, driver and other mechanical parts which is already in place in terms of in-house manufacturing due to ICE Vehicles and home appliances manufacturing hub in India, there may be a need to upgrade at some extent as per EV standards.

o Raw material availability: Raw material for batteries, semiconductor and other electronic items is very less in India. Although, due to current government initiatives the electronic items like TVs, Mobiles, PCs are now assembled in India but raw material availability to be managed at a very large scale to cope up with the demand and supply.

o Push for 100% made in India purchase: With all the efforts, supply won’t be achieved unless we push full made in India purchase at least in the public sector. As of now, the public sector is the only largest buyer in the EV industry in India and to encourage the EV industry, the government should think about the revision of public purchase policy for the entire manufacturing industry.

7) What are EVI Technologies’ expansion plans in terms of product and reach?

We are planning to set up charging and battery swapping stations in different cities of India for electric two and three-wheeler by FY 20-21 Q2, it will come up with Lithium batteries with the fast charge or swap option. The battery will be supplied by their preferred battery OEMs only. The backbone of the system includes IT infrastructure on the server end, which will manage the complete transaction of charging and battery swapping. They have executed the process in Maharashtra, Goa, Haryana, UP (West), Delhi-NCR in phase -1 of their current plan.

R&D is the backbone of EVI Technologies, since the formation of the company we have developed 4 different chargers suitable to the Indian market and vehicles, ranging from 3.3 kW AC charger to 7.4 kW Type 2 AC charger, 15 kW DC Charger, 50 KW CCS Charger and Battery Swapping station.

8) Opinion | An EV revolution will require a structured approach to electrifying different segments of vehicles in stages. What would you say is a good approach to India’s ascent to EV adoption? How can the government help in terms of policies and incentives?

For any revolution to happen in a structured way we need to have a proper approach with both short term and long-term goals and we believe proper policy planning and eco-system offering to end customers may lead to faster and better adoption of EVs in India.

Instead of putting upfront battery cost on customers, it can be charged as fuel cost during refilling of battery and this will lead to a reduction of vehicle cost by half, price parity with ICE engine vehicles or may be lower than that.

The government should form clusters where EV should be adopted first to have more environmental impact instead of making a generic policy for the whole country. We have to trade off the environmental impact with EV price also.

Technology has proven its role in enhancing efficiency, improving access, as well as encouraging transparency, accountability, and adherence to timelines in dealing with legal matters. The World Economic Forum 2018 emphasised the role of IT in various fields, including the legal profession, stating that ‘computing has become much cheaper and digital equipment and devices has become widely available, faster and more cheaply available’. Data is the oxygen for machine learning and artificial intelligence. The World Economic Forum 2018 emphasised the need for increased investment in artificial intelligence, research, and cross-border collaboration.

India has taken a variety of measures to automate processes within the judiciary with an aim to improve efficiency and eliminate the time lost in unproductive work. Some of the initiatives are: easy accessibility to online case records and previous judicial pronouncements, reducing dependency on stenographers by utilising voice recognition software, usage of video conferencing facilities to increase the reach of courts, case management systems, e-registry of court, automated preparation of cause-lists, phasing out physical records though e-filing and e-submission of documents, etc.

The initiatives mentioned are proactively implemented to automate processes on the judicial side. However, as the government is considered to be the biggest litigant in India, it is equally important to digitise, automate, and monitor cases from the ministry/department’s side for cases where the government is a litigant. It is for this purpose that the LIMBS was put in place.

LIMBS is a web-based application for monitoring cases involving the central government of India, in a more effective and transparent manner. It is an initiative of the Department of Legal Affairs (DoLA), Ministry of Law and Justice, and aims to digitise the legal process and monitor the entire life cycle of a case. Through a Gazette Notification issued on 8 February 2016 by DoLA, all ministries of the Government of India and their departments, sub- departments, and attached offices were brought under the ambit of LIMBS. It is an innovative and easy-to-access online tool which is available 24×7 to all stakeholders—government officials, department users, nodal officers, higher officials of ministries, advocates, arbitrators, and claimants of 62 ministries. Users can upload latest information regarding a case, and that will be available on a real time basis on a single unified platform to avoid confusion, delay, and financial burden on public exchequer. In a short span of 3.5 years, LIMBS has created a centralised database of 4.07 lakh court cases in which the Union of India is a party, as well as 2,500 arbitration cases.

LIMBS provides a standard GUI screen to capture basic information about court cases and provides an elaborate set of user-friendly reports which allow the higher administration as well as clerks to concurrently monitor the progress of cases. Through its system generated SMS alerts, the higher administration is informed regarding upcoming important cases, contempt cases, Special Leave Petitions, appeals, etc. The system also sends SMSs to users, concerned officers, and advocates regarding forthcoming cases, seven days prior to the hearing in court; this helps the administration remain aware of upcoming case hearings, and ensures that no case remains unnoticed or unprepared for. LIMBS also has a Unique Digital Locker (UDL) and e-document vault which allows users to upload documents that can act as institutional memories. LIMBS also provides a one-page summary report and graphs that have resulted in a perceptible improvement in the working of legal processes in ministries. Thus, through LIMBS, pending court cases are being closely monitored by higher administration of the concerned ministries, the NITI Aayog, DoLA, etc. Further, more than 16,000 advocates are registered with LIMBS, this helps in uploading first-hand information on the system as well as facilitates the timely processing of advocate bills.

LIMBS has a structured database where all relevant information about a case, since its inception, can be found. This includes information regarding the drafting of pleadings, preparation of internal notes and advice by the legal department, filing of a case in court, capturing each proceeding in the court, the final judgment copy, etc. A compilation of over 60 attributes regarding each case facilitates the analysis of cases. LIMBS assists the administration in having a data-driven approach to decision making based on trustworthy, meaningful, authoritative, and precise data.

The following features of LIMBS illustrate the focused approach it has in trying to reduce pendency.

Clubbing of cases

It has often been suggested that cases of a similar nature be clubbed so that they can be dealt with as a combined case. If cases were being monitored manually, information regarding the cases would be scattered and it would, therefore, be time consuming and difficult to combine cases of a similar nature. However, with the implementation of LIMBS, these adversities have been blown-away electronically; as LIMBS is a structured database, the utilisation of artificial intelligence and standard algorithms can help with clubbing cases of a similar nature. This will allow ministries to prepare a combined reply to these cases, and they can be contested in the court as a single/clubbed case. Such clubbing of cases will help decrease the amount of time and effort that the court, as well as the administration, would have to put in. Thus, LIMBS can play an influential role in reducing at least 20 per cent of central government related litigation by enabling the clubbing of similar cases.

Harmonisation of policy

LIMBS has a structured database which can prompt policymakers and researchers to ascertain strained areas where there is a high volume of litigation arising due to ambiguity in policies. It can become a catalyst to improving policies by simplifying, streamlining, and harmonising them with an aim to eliminate unnecessary litigation. The elimination of ambiguities with the help of LIMBS can further the cause of ease of doing business, and therefore become instrumental for good governance.

Use of real-time analytics

Prior to LIMBS, information regarding cases of the central government was dispersed, and it was hence difficult to assimilate the right information at the right time. Through the use of LIMBS, this situation has been dealt with and analytical tools are able to provide precise information when required. LIMBS provides dashboards, graphs, summarised reports, and detailed data sheets which cater to the needs of government officials. Cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning can also help the administration take action effectively. LIMBS allows stakeholders to monitor cases on real time basis and is a promising step to check the increasing pendency.

Predictive and perspective analysis

Dashboards and graphical representations are in-built in the LIMBS application for in-depth analysis of cases. However, the higher administration contemplates more use of the data. The idea of ‘smart data discovery’ is being preferred, wherein smart analytical tools help identify trends in the data. The benefit of this approach is that it is less subjective or biased to human interpretation, when compared with traditional analytics. LIMBS at a self-actualisation stage, can help with predictive analyses. For example, while filing a case in court, when a user selects the name of the court, the system will be able to provide information regarding the approximate time it will take the court to dispose the case, based on past trends. While selecting the advocate, the system can provide information regarding the percentage of cases that the advocate won, as per past records.

Further, through machine learning, the system can provide a list of previous judgments and replies submitted in similar cases that were dealt with in the past. Bibek Debroy had once said ‘on all civil cases, not just Union government ones, the moment issues are framed, one more or less (in 90 per cent of cases) knows the eventual outcome, within a band, not precisely. Litigation merely prolongs the journey towards a certain outcome’.7 As LIMBS provides all the required relevant information, it can help users predict the chances of winning a case. It can, therefore, act as a catalyst in helping the administration avoid unnecessary litigation and become a tool to reduce the burden of the judiciary.

Mining of text

Text mining based on deep learning algorithms is a method to categorise text from unstructured data into structured data. Text mining allows the computer to read documents which are spread over several pages and accessible in .pdf, .doc, and excel formats. It helps categorise the text with dynamic indexes, allows users to retrieve the same at a faster pace, and can prepare a synopsis by analysing the text. LIMBS is a rich source of information as it contains uploaded documents such as replies, counter replies, affidavits, contempt notices, judgments, etc. Text mining of these documents will allow the users to access relevant information in the shortest possible time with a high accuracy. Machine learning may further refine accessible data and assist the administration in making a faster reply. The introduction of objectivity in the system will help the administration quickly identify the next steps to be taken to curb pendency.

"Cloud technology has advanced to the forefront as millions of people around the world are using computing technology to work remotely due to the outbreak of Covid-19. In the future, it will enable seamless pathways from classrooms to careers at all education levels. Seven higher-level educational institutions recently chose AWS as their choice of platform for this far-reaching approach to enhance students with cloud skills.

With this, the institutions are aiming for a cloud curriculum from AWS Educate, which gives a practical learning experience for students much needed for today’s job market. Under the AWS Educate global initiative, the cloud giant has provided students and educators with the resources required to speed up cloud-related learning by designing college degree programs with cloud computing curriculum.

The goal of the initiative is also to bring cloud computing to mainstream college syllabus and produce the next generation of cloud specialists in India. The cloud computing curriculum is going to be included as an undergraduate degree and postgraduate diploma programs commencing in September 2020.

Take Manav Rachna University for example. By working with AWS Educate, the university’s spokesperson says it will provide students with updated knowledge and the skills, as well as enhance their professional development and access to AWS Cloud services. Apart from specialized courses in cloud computing, Manav Rachna University’s core computer science courses also cover cloud concepts in database management, networking, and operating systems, that helps students in preparing for practical cloud computing-based roles.

Which Colleges Are Part Of The Program?

The higher education institutions offering the newly-designed Bachelor of Technology degree programs in Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science are:

Six education institutions offering engineering degrees: Manav Rachna University, Sharda University, Chitkara University, Galgotias University, Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, and SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Tamil Nadu.



One higher education institution offering a postgraduate diploma in Management: ASM Group of Institutes in Maharashtra will offer syllabus combined with the AWS Educate cloud curricula for its Post Graduate Diploma in Management – Emerging Technology.

“This enhanced cloud curriculum will interest prospective students as it includes both theoretical as well as practical hands-on experience of the latest cloud technologies driving innovation in areas such as machine learning services, internet-of-things, and cybersecurity. The collaboration with AWS, the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, is not just a significant milestone for Galgotias University, but also for the students as it provides them globally-relevant skills and recognition,” says Dhruv Galgotia, CEO of Galgotias University.

Cloud computing has been the topmost workforce skill demanded by companies, as reported by a LinkedIn study done yearly over the past five years. This new initiative will integrate cloud computing curricula in mainstream college education and help approach the increasing demand for cloud skills in India by equipping students with the relevant education and skill-based credentials related to the cloud including cloud architecture, software development, cybersecurity data analytics and machine learning.

Dr Madhu Chitkara, Pro-Chancellor, Chitkara University, Punjab says the cloud curriculum from AWS Educate focuses on the fundamentals of cloud computing, modelling, analysis, design and deployment, which are relevant to industry-centric application development. It also includes industry standards for applications in the cloud and essential practices on cloud security.

“Cloud computing is shifting the paradigms of the IT industry and in the future. Businesses need to focus on core competencies instead of managing the complexity of data centres. More businesses are adopting cloud computing for the day-to-day management of their IT infrastructure. To fulfil the skills needed for the future, we have to start today,” said Dr Madhu.

AWS Educate Goal Is To Partake Next-Gen Of IT Professionals

All students partaking in the degree and diploma programs will be enrolled in AWS Educate, which is Amazon’s initiative to equip students and teachers with resources for honing skills in cloud technology. Educate lays emphasis on real-world, practical learning activities so that it can generate IT and cloud professionals with the right capabilities to handle the growing technological complexities.

Also, AWS Educate grants access to the AWS Educate Job Board, a speciality that enables students to explore and apply for thousands of cloud jobs and internship openings from Amazon and other businesses around the globe. AWS Educate is used in more than 200 countries and territories, connecting more than 3,500 institutions, over 10,000 teachers, and hundreds of thousands of learners.

“Cloud technology has come to the forefront as millions of people around the world are using computing technology to work remotely due to the outbreak of Covid-19. In the future, it will enable seamless pathways from classrooms to careers at all education levels. AWS is a natural choice for this far-reaching and transformative approach to enrich students with cloud skills. The cloud curriculum from AWS Educate provides an outstanding learning experience for students, and promotes research and development,” said Dr Sandeep Sancheti, Vice-Chancellor, SRM Institute of Science & Technology.

According to Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, Greater Noida, the college has identified cloud computing as one of our core focus areas for the future and is optimistic about associated with AWS in India to impart cloud computing learning to its engineering students.

“Cloud computing is omnipresent in today’s work environment. Organisations using cloud computing can easily access their resources across multiple platforms, and create a strong foundation for collaborative working. The curriculum has the potential to open a new horizon of employment possibilities for our students,” Raman Batra, Executive Vice President of the institute says.

AWS Educate educations programs are being organised in close collaboration with the government and government-associated organisations like NASSCOM and ICT Academy are collaborating to support AWS in this initiative. NASSCOM will enable larger industry participation by engaging major employers in IT and ITES segments in India and facilitate a talent pipeline honed with cloud skills. ICT Academy, a not-for-profit organisation that operates within the Government of India and collaborates with state governments and enterprises to train higher education teachers and industry-ready students, will also support the educational institutions with faculty development and curriculum arrangement.

"Dealmakers in India will be busier than ever as global investors are going to follow Facebook Inc. and Google in deploying capital into the country, according to Carlyle Group.The South Asian nation has become Carlyle’s No. 2 investment destination in Asia after China, according to Gregory M. Zeluck, its Hong Kong-based managing director and co-head for buyout funds in the region. The U.S. firm has announced two deals in India in the past month -- an acquisition of a 20% stake in billionaire Ajay Piramal ’s pharmaceutical business for $490 million and paying $235 million for a stake in Bharti Airtel Ltd. ’s data-center business.India emerged as a rare bright spot for dealmaking this year, thanks in large part to $19.5 billion of investments in Mukesh Ambani ’s technology ventures from Carlyle’s rivals such as KKR & Co. as well as the likes of Facebook and Google . The Silicon Valley giants are coming after India’s half a billion Internet users, whose growing embrace of everything from e-commerce to messaging and digital payments is drawing comparisons to the early days of China’s technology boom.Overseas investment into both China and India has swelled enormously in the past two decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China receives tens of billions more per year than its Asian rival, yet investment there peaked in 2015, before trade tensions, including the long-simmering dispute with the U.S., began to weigh on deals. By contrast, foreign investment into India last year was 134% higher than in 2015.“China has just taken off in the last decade from an investment perspective and India is sure to follow,” Zeluck said in an interview. “It looks like we are on the inflection point now, this year and next year. I wouldn’t say it is going to explode but it is going to grow very substantially in the next five to seven years.”Carlyle plans to step up investing in India’s media and digital sectors, Zeluck said. While the International Monetary Fund is forecasting that India’s economy will contract as one of the world’s biggest and strictest lockdowns takes its toll, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will potentially be beneficial for health care, he added.“Some logistics may be a bit of issue, getting control of Covid at the beginning can be an issue,” Zeluck said. “Through the economic downturn, particularly pharma may show some upside as well. So pharmaceuticals and health care in general are two verticals that we think are investible at this point in time.”Tensions between China and the U.S. will also prompt supply chains to move into India, Zeluck said. The pharmaceutical industry will be the biggest beneficiary, and electronics and other manufacturing may also see a shift, he added.“We are very excited about India,” Zeluck said. “There were some economic troubles the country has already been facing. But we have a tremendous level of confidence that India will rebound and will be a great investment for the long term.”",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Economic Times,"Carlyle sees India M&A accelerating on pharma, technology deals",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/carlyle-sees-india-ma-accelerating-on-pharma-technology-deals/articleshow/77070601.cms
"Yotta Infrastructure, a Hiranandani Group subsidiary and a Managed Data Centre Service Provider developing hyper-scale data centre parks in India, today inaugurated India’s largest data center building, Yotta NM1, in a virtual event. It is the largest Tier IV Data Center certified by Uptime Institute in Asia and second largest in the world.

With proximity to Mumbai and Pune, Yotta NM1 Data Center is located in the 600-acre Hiranandani Fortune City in Panvel. Yotta NM1 is first of the five data center buildings coming up at this Integrated Yotta Data Center Park, which, once fully built, will have an overall capacity of 30,000 racks and 250 MW power. At 820,000 sq. ft, 7,200 racks, 50 MW of power and 4 redundant self-owned fiber paths connecting the DC to national highways, the first DC Yotta NM1 itself offers a highly scalable data centre infrastructure, capable of hosting global cloud, content and OTT operators besides the mission-critical applications of enterprises and governments. The ultramodern building, supported by a highly redundant on-site power infrastructure shall soon be powered by its own captive solar power plant and an on-site captive gas-based co-gen power plant thus delivering to its hosted customers long term reliable, green and cost-effective source of power.

Speaking at the virtual event, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon. Minister for Communications, Electronics & Information Technology and Law & Justice, Govt of India said, “A good data center infrastructure is critical for a robust digital economy and with this data center the Hiranandani Group has yet again delivered on their standards of creating a new benchmark in every industry that they operate in. Under the vision of the Honorable Prime Minister we have launched the Digital India initiative – to empower the country with technology, bridge the divide and bring digital inclusion, and all of this must be achieved through technology that is homegrown. This particular data center is a powerful statement of intent that India is rising high in the quest of data security, data use and data innovation. For the success of Digital India, we must become a big global Data Refinery – data cleaning, data processing, data innovation and research – and all of this will need to be done keeping in mind data privacy laws. We shall never compromise on the data sovereignty of India. The data economy has a lot of potential and in all its promise – a good data center is the pillar it builds on.”

With the pandemic fast-tracking the digital transformation efforts across enterprises and mass transition to remote working, Canalys Global reported that cloud spends were at a record high in Q12020, up 34% during the time. As enterprises increase their dependency on cloud services, and as India becomes increasingly digital, shifting speedily to web collaboration, e-commerce, e-payments, emerging technologies like AI, ML, IoT, Robotics, connected cars, and as 5G adoption permeates, the resultant growth in generated data is humongous and requires a massive buildout of evolved data processing and storage facilities i.e. data centers. Initiatives under the Digital India campaign are further accelerating the growth in India’s data center industry.

Commenting on the development, Dr Niranjan Hiranandani, Co-founder and Managing Director of the Hiranandani Group, said, “Enterprises and Governments are now focusing more than ever before on Self-Reliance (“Atmanirbhar”) in their supply chains within the country, also leading to more emphasis on data privacy/protection and consequently on data localisation. The demand for hyper-scale data centers is on the rise, thanks to the Government’s push for the National E-commerce Policy and proposed policy on Data Center Parks. Also, with the new normal established due to COVID-19, reliance on technology from enterprises and consumers has increased. All these factors together make for a tremendous growth story for data centers in India. What makes the Yotta story unique is our ownership of all key input resources, massive economies of scale with our land banks, captive green energy generation and distribution capabilities and unmatched expertise and experience in Data Center domain including design, engineering, construction and operations.”

Besides Navi Mumbai, Yotta is also developing similar sized giant Data Center Parks at Chennai and New Delhi. Each of these parks will feature more than 20,000 racks, 200 MW plus power and multiple self-owned fiber paths connecting the Park to the main highways. Yotta envisages to spend about INR 3500 crores in next 3 years and about INR 15,000 crore over next 7 to 10 years across these Data Center parks.

Sunil Gupta, Managing Partner & CEO – Yotta Infrastructure, said, “Foreign hyperscale cloud players and OTT companies are looking to set up large bases in India. A hyper-scale Data Centre Park with the scalable ecosystem of power, fiber and skillsets, like what Yotta offers, gives them quick access to large colo capacity from day one from a multi-tenanted data centre like NM1 and also gives them long term sustainability at the same site with the availability of customised single tenanted data centres and in-campus fiber networks. Enterprises can expect from Yotta a fully managed hybrid IT infrastructure – a combination of colo, private cloud, public cloud and IT management skills on a low-risk, pay-as-you-use model, that creates a win-win situation for everyone. Yotta hit the ground running within a year, and I am pleased to say that the interest garnered by Yotta from enterprises has been overwhelming. We are pleased to house many anchor customers at Yotta NM1 already, and the list will only continue to grow.”

"Oracle Corp on Wednesday said it is now offering to put all of its cloud computing technology inside its customers' data centers for an $18 million spending commitment over three years and has signed customers in Japan and Oman.Cloud computing emerged more than a decade ago. Technology companies, such as Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services , used their expertise at owning and operating data centers efficiently to rent out computing capacity and software tools to other businesses over the internet But many businesses that turned to cloud providers still handled at least part of their computing inside their own data centers. This was either for speed reasons - connecting to a cloud data center takes time for data to travel over the internet - or to meet legal or regulatory requirements about where data must be stored.To address those customers, all major cloud providers - including Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc's Google and International Business Machines Corp - offer ""hybrid"" options to make it easier for customers to use cloud technology inside their own data centers.Many of those approaches rely on a business using the cloud provider's software on their own hardware, which limits the number of cloud features offered.Oracle, by contrast, asks for space inside a customer's data center and drops in its own cloud hardware and software, offering all the same services as if Oracle owned the data center, and handling all maintenance.

"Hyderabad — An year after launching its first data center in India, Oracle has now launched a second data center in the country. The newly launched ‘Cloud region’ in Hyderabad follows the company’s investment in Mumbai ‘Cloud region’ in 2019.

“With two Oracle Cloud regions live in India, we’re fully geared to support our 15000 plus customers in their innovation journey, with adequate support by nearly 1000 specialized Oracle partners,” said Shailender Kumar, Regional Managing Director, Oracle India.

The American technology giant said the opening is part of its global plans to operate 36 second-generation Cloud regions by the end of 2020. With this launch now businesses in India will have access to all Oracle Cloud services, including Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Autonomous Linux, as well as Oracle Cloud Applications, to unlock innovation and drive business growth.

“We congratulate Oracle India on opening their second Cloud region in Hyderabad. This will surely help both public and private enterprises in our state to take advantage of Oracle cloud services,” said Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, Industries & Commerce (I&C) and Information Technology (IT), Government of Telangana.

Oracle said that it will provide enterprise customers in India better performance, pricing, and security based on its second-generation Cloud. With this launch, India joins the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, South Korea, and the European Union in having multiple Oracle Cloud regions.

“With Oracle opening dual cloud regions in Australia, Japan, Korea and now India, we are further renewing our commitment to support growth in the new decade,” said Garrett Ilg, Executive Vice President, Japan and Asia Pacific, Oracle.

"Demand for data centers in India could as much as double within 5 years, report indicates

Consumer & enterprise demand coupled with a friendlier regulatory environment could see the local data center sector take off

The pandemic helped drive data digital acceleration initiatives amongst businesses on the subcontinent

Since being introduced in India in the mid-2010s, data centers have been growing in importance as more and more organizations drive demand for hybrid cloud and multi-cloud computing capabilities.

Many enterprises now run critical applications and carry out testing, research, and development data requirement within on-premises or offsite data storage locations. And as the data requirements continue expanding, hyper scaled data centers are being constructed in city hubs around the country.

Now a recent report by CBRE finds that the Indian data center market across Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, and the National Capital Region are expected to experience a 40% data supply increase this year. Presently, the Mumbai data center has 41% data capacity filled, while the Bangalore and Delhi centers are next most-occupied at 17% and 16%, respectively.

The hike in demand for digital services throughout the country’s COVID-19 lockdown experience, has seen big spikes in online gaming, virtual learning platforms, video streaming services, and e-commerce usage, among others.

The consumer demand in addition to the data consumption by data-driven businesses and other organizations has seen data centers in India continue to scale up to meet the active demand. The rising demand is expected to be supported by a friendlier regulatory environment for the booming data economy on the Indian subcontinent, according to Anshuman Magazine, CBRE’s Chairman & CEO – India, South East Asia, Middle East & Africa.

“In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, we expect regulatory support to augment the Data Centre demand in India,” Magazine commented. “Policy impetus such as the National E-commerce Policy, Personal Data Protection Bill, proposed policy on Data Centre Parks and digital initiatives by the government will accelerate demand.”

And while industries around India cut expenditures and lay off staff because of the coronavirus, CBRE instead expects the pandemic to actually accelerate development and addition of data centers in the country. “The COVID-19 situation will further propel the next wave of growth in the sector and most importantly, the proposal to give DCs the coveted ‘Infrastructure status’ will place them high on global investor radar.”

The pandemic could stimulate enterprises to invest in cloud and hybrid IT infrastructures, with more companies migrating their operations online and corporate staff working from home in larger numbers than ever before.

CBRE anticipates that such demand drivers could cause other Indian cities like Kolkata, Pune, Gurgaon, Kochi and Jaipur to be among the first locales to construct edge data centers, owing to those urban centers’ abilities to service different geographic hubs around the country.

“Demand for outsourced data center solutions has increased in India and we understand that occupiers would require flexible, scalable data center solutions that are both operationally and financially optimal,” says Ram Chandnani, the Managing Director, Advisory & Transaction Services, for CBRE South Asia Pvt. Ltd.

There are at least ten data center projects which are expected to become operational between June 2020 and December 2022. Market research from Arizton indicates that the data center sector in India will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5% between now and 2025.

“Technology and automation would provide significant opportunities in terms of how data center operations evolve as we move forward in the next 3-5 years,” noted CBRE South Asia’s Chandnani.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Tech Wire Asia,Demand for data centers in India could double by 2025,https://techwireasia.com/2020/06/demand-for-data-centers-in-india-could-double-by-2025/

Mumbai: Dealmakers in India will be busier than ever as global investors are going to follow Facebook Inc. and Google in deploying capital into the country, according to Carlyle Group.

The South Asian nation has become Carlyle’s No. 2 investment destination in Asia after China, according to Gregory M. Zeluck, its Hong Kong-based managing director and co-head for buyout funds in the region. The U.S. firm has announced two deals in India in the past month — an acquisition of a 20% stake in billionaire Ajay Piramal’s pharmaceutical business for $490 million and paying $235 million for a stake in Bharti Airtel Ltd.’s data-center business.

India emerged as a rare bright spot for dealmaking this year, thanks in large part to $19.5 billion of investments in Mukesh Ambani’s technology ventures from Carlyle’s rivals such as KKR & Co. as well as the likes of Facebook and Google. The Silicon Valley giants are coming after India’s half a billion Internet users, whose growing embrace of everything from e-commerce to messaging and digital payments is drawing comparisons to the early days of China’s technology boom.

Overseas investment into both China and India has swelled enormously in the past two decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China receives tens of billions more per year than its Asian rival, yet investment there peaked in 2015, before trade tensions, including the long-simmering dispute with the U.S., began to weigh on deals. By contrast, foreign investment into India last year was 134% higher than in 2015.

“China has just taken off in the last decade from an investment perspective and India is sure to follow,” Zeluck said in an interview. “It looks like we are on the inflection point now, this year and next year. I wouldn’t say it is going to explode but it is going to grow very substantially in the next five to seven years.”

Carlyle plans to step up investing in India’s media and digital sectors, Zeluck said. While the International Monetary Fund is forecasting that India’s economy will contract as one of the world’s biggest and strictest lockdowns takes its toll, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will potentially be beneficial for health care, he added.

“Some logistics may be a bit of issue, getting control of Covid at the beginning can be an issue,” Zeluck said. “Through the economic downturn, particularly pharma may show some upside as well. So pharmaceuticals and health care in general are two verticals that we think are investible at this point in time.”

Tensions between China and the U.S. will also prompt supply chains to move into India, Zeluck said. The pharmaceutical industry will be the biggest beneficiary, and electronics and other manufacturing may also see a shift, he added.

“We are very excited about India,” Zeluck said. “There were some economic troubles the country has already been facing. But we have a tremendous level of confidence that India will rebound and will be a great investment for the long term.” – Bloomberg

"India's largest Data Center building, Yotta NM1, the largest Tier IV Data Center, certified by Uptime Institute in Asia, and the second largest in the world was inaugurated in the virtual presence of Uddhav Thackeray, Hon. Chief Minister, Maharashtra; Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hon. Minister for Communications, Electronics & Information Technology and Law & Justice, Govt. of India and Subhash Desai, Hon. Minister of Industries and Mining, Govt. of Maharashtra.

What makes the Yotta story unique is our ownership of all key input resources, massive economies of scale with our land banks, captive green energy generation and distribution capabilities and unmatched expertise and experience in Data Center domain including design, engineering, construction and operations, said Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani, MD and Co-founder, Hiranandani Group.

""This Data Center is a global pioneer not just in terms of capability and price but more so in terms of its focus on efficiency and sustainability. We provide the most efficient power offering available in the market today – not just the lowest price of power but also a Power Usage Efficiency or PUE that is a global benchmark for the tropics,” said Darshan Hiranandani, Group CEO – Hiranandani Group.

Being an industry leader is also about being ahead of the curve, and when it comes to diversifying into the segment of data centres, the MD and co-founder, Hiranandani Group has timed it to perfection. In the second half of 2019, he announced setting up of Yotta Infrastructure, a Hiranandani Group subsidiary and a Managed Data Centre Service Provider, which would develop hyper-scale data centre parks in India.

For a real estate developer better known for its integrated townships to foray into the shared data centre space may have raised questions in mid-2019, but it has been a story of right timing and leveraging the right set of tech-specs which made the project future-ready. Originally seen as a segment of commercial real estate where the primary activity was to build and lease buildings to corporates to store their data, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen an upsurge of end-users from different segments, including e-commerce, online banking, entertainment, education and OTT.

The Initial stage is termed as Phase zero (0). The plan is to migrate to renewables and gas-based combined heat and power generation on site will provide chilled water at the most efficient cost structure possible and will bring design PUE numbers down to 1.2 – again unheard of in Indian weather conditions. But the plan does not stop there; it includes building facilities today to ensure that can be future ready, to run 100 per cent on renewables whether offsite through solar and wind coupled with on-site Hydrogen based co-generation and fuel cells in the future.

Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani has ambitious plans of potentially investing about ₹ 3500 crores in datacenter business across Navi Mumbai, Chennai to begin with. The group has already made Rs 1000crs investment in its first data centre going live at our Hiranandani Fortune City township in Panvel. He attributes the initial interest in the segment to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spoke about a ‘digital India’; a ‘Make in India’; data to be located and stored in India and plans to achieve a $5 trillion economy. The past couple of years had seen these aspects take the data centre space to growth levels of over 100 per cent year-on-year.



This prompted setting up of the 100 per cent subsidiary of the Hiranandani Group, Yotta, which will offer hyper-density, hyper-scalable data centre and co-location solutions to enterprises with supporting managed IT, hybrid multi cloud and security services. The Group already has the expertise for building data centres, it has the land suitable for data centres as also the most important - expertise of power efficiency. These put together, will create efficiency-plus data centres, with operating costs estimated to reduce by 20 per cent.

Beginning with Panvel, where Yotta’s growth plans began with building of the data centre park - the country’s largest, spread over 18 acres, comprising five data centres and 30,000 racks. Amidst projections at the time Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani announced setting up of Yotta, which showed huge demand for data centres in the near future, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a sharp spike in quantum of data centre spaces, and Yotta, its start-up stage at the first such building in Panvel, has been able to handle the quantum leap in demand for data centre spaces.

The COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown and work from home (WFH) have multiplied digital and online transactions, these all reflect in incremental demand at data centers, be it to power collaborative tools like Zoom; usage of enterprise tools like SAP or net banking, as also on the consumer side, OTT platforms for entertainment like Netflix, Hotstar etc. There is a 30 to 30 per cent hike in data center capacity usage, and even after the situation returns to ‘normal’, the work style will continue to be data center driven, and demand growth will continue.

As enterprises and Government agencies now focus more than ever before on Self-Reliance (Atmanirbhar) in their supply chains within the country, this has also lead to more emphasis on data privacy/protection and consequently on data localisation.

The demand for hyper-scale data centers is on the rise, thanks to Governments push for the National E-commerce Policy and proposed policy on Data Center Parks. Also, with the new normal established due to COVID, reliance on technology from enterprises and consumers has increased. All these factors together make for a tremendous growth story for data centers in India.

What makes the Yotta story unique is the Hiranandani Group’s ownership of all key input resources, massive economies of scale with our land banks, captive green energy generation and distribution capabilities and unmatched expertise and experience in Data Center domain including design, engineering, construction and operations.

Data Centers are a ‘sunrise’ segment in Indian commercial real estate, and it shows potential to grow at a fast pace. Sectors such as BFSI, logistics, transportation, e-commerce, media and

entertainment as also government agencies are driving high demand for data centers. For the team at Yotta, the formal inauguration caps on-going negotiations with a large number of potential users, these should get implemented once the lockdown is truly lifted and ‘normalcy’ returns to the Indian economy.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",http://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/,Hiranandani Group unveils Asia's Largest Data Centre at Navi Mumbai,https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/sectors/7757-hiranandani-group-unveils-asias-largest-data-centre-at-navi-mumbai
"Canadian quantum computing company D-Wave Systems is launching its cloud service in India, giving developers and researchers in the country real-time access to its quantum computers.

Through this geographic expansion, D-Wave’s 2000Q quantum computers, hybrid solvers and the application environment can be used via its cloud platform Leap to drive development of business-critical and in-production hybrid applications.

“Quantum computing is poised to fundamentally transform the way businesses solve critical problems, leading to new efficiencies and profound business value in industries like transportation, finance, pharmaceuticals and much more,” Murray Thom, VP of Software and Services at D-Wave, said in a statement.

“The future of quantum computing is in the cloud. That’s why we were eager to expand Leap to India and Australia, where vibrant tech scenes will have access to real-time quantum computers and the hybrid solver service for the first time, unlocking new opportunities across industries.”

As part of this rollout, users in India and Australia can work on the D-Wave’s Leap and Leap 2 platforms.

The two cloud platforms offer updated features and tools, including hybrid solver service that can solve large and complex problems of up to 10,000 variables; and integrated developer environment that has a prebuilt, ready-to-code environment in the cloud configured with the latest Ocean SDK for quantum hybrid development in Python.

D-Wave’s systems and software have been used in financial modelling, machine learning and route optimization.

Its latest launch in India comes about a year after the country’s Department of Science and Technology (DST) chalked out plans to build its own quantum computers.

In early 2019, DST launched a programme focused on quantum computing, called Quantum-Enabled Science and Technology (QuEST). As part of QuEST, India earmarked ₹80 crore investment to be spent over a span of three years to facilitate research in setting up quantum computers.

A year later, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Union Budget 2020 Speech, announced a National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications (NM-QTA) with an outlay of ₹8,000 crore for the next five years.

“Quantum technology is opening up new frontiers in computing, communications, cyber security with wide-spread applications,” Sitharaman said in her Budget Speech.

“It is expected that lots of commercial applications would emerge from theoretical constructs which are developing in this area.”

NM-QTA’s focus, as outlined by the minister, will be in fundamental science, translation, technology development and, human and infrastructural resource generation.

Other areas of quantum computing applications will include aero-space engineering, numerical weather prediction, simulations, securing communication and financial transactions, cyber-security, and advanced manufacturing.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",The Hindu,D-Wave’s quantum computing cloud comes to India,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/d-waves-quantum-computing-cloud-comes-to-india/article32145904.ece

"BENGALURU : Major Indian information technology (IT) services companies reported strong growth from digital business in the June quarter, despite the covid-19 impact and global challenges. This helped maintain buoyancy as clients transitioned to work-from-home and demand for cloud, collaboration and cybersecurity-related technologies shot up.

Typically, practices that cover emerging technologies like cloud, mobility, analytics, internet of things, and cybersecurity are clubbed under the digital business. Until recently, most IT services companies separately reported their digital revenues but the trend is changing as digital has increasingly become part of their mainstream offerings.

“Digital is definitely mainstream for IT service providers. Comparing digital revenues across providers can be difficult because different providers use different definitions for digital revenue,"" said Dean Blackmore, senior director analyst, Gartner. “We estimate that in 2019, non-digital IT services revenue was still around 52% of total IT spending. However, by 2023 that will drop to around 31%,"" Blackmore said.

Digital has become so “mainstream"" for Bengaluru-based Wipro, that they have done away with a separate classification for their digital business from the June quarter onwards. “We believe digital has now become a mainstream capability for us and also it has reached a scale where you don’t need to separately call it out as it has become very pervasive for us,"" said Bhanumurthy B.M., chief operating officer, Wipro.

India’s largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd had stopped reporting its digital revenues from Q3 FY20 onwards, as the lines between digital and core offerings were getting blurred.

CIOs aims to optimize costs with accelerated adoption of public and hybrid cloud model, which is driving growth in cloud revenues this quarter, said Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD), TCS.

“Our pipeline from a digital infrastructure and cloud perspective has actually been the highest in the last many quarters. A lot of the large deals that we see is coming from an accelerated adoption of the core infrastructure and compute fabric transformation which is a key enabler for switching to this mode at a large scale basis,"" Gopinathan said in a post-earnings call recently.

Infosys Ltd, which continues to note their digital revenues separately, saw its digital revenue grow 25.5% y-o-y in constant currency to $1.38 billion for the first quarter- ended June, to contribute 44.5% to the total revenue. Earlier this month, Infosys signed a large deal with US investment management firm Vanguard to drive digital transformation of their record-keeping services onto a cloud business platform, which Infosys believes is an indication of strong growth momentum in digital.

“The whole crisis has accelerated the digital thinking across most large enterprises. We see a lot of demand in areas of cloud, workplace transformation, automation, and cost-efficiency,"" Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys, said in the Q1 earnings call.

HCL Technologies along with its partners is helping customers embrace digital transformation to emerge stronger in a post-covid world. “I am confident that, with decisive action leveraging digital momentum and sustainable business practices, we will together emerge as stronger entities,"" said chief strategy officer and MD Shiv Nadar.

Some analysts, however, believe sharing digital revenues separately provided more clarity although some change in reporting structure is inevitable.

“Traditional services like application development and maintenance (ADM), testing and infrastructure support have been under severe pressure for long. So, the focus on digital will continue and especially areas like cloud and customer experience will become more and more mainstream in the coming days,"" said Harit Shah, a Mumbai-based IT analyst.

"India is emerging as a key hub for public cloud-based services in Asia. India’s public cloud market is dominated by three webscale players: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure , and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Boston Consulting Group (BCG) values this market around USD$3 billion in 2020, and estimates the market to grow by 25% CAGR to USD$8 billion by 2023. In our perspective, India’s public cloud infrastructure includes regional data centres owned by webscale players, as well as more than 100 others distributed across the country, that are either network-neutral data centres or owned by telecom service providers.Traditionally, webscale players have been dominating the public cloud service offerings in system infrastructure services (i.e. IaaS, including compute instances, storage databases, etc.), application infrastructure services (i.e. PaaS, including containers, artificial intelligence, and machine learning , etc.) and software services (i.e. SaaS for various applications). Now webscale players are expanding IaaS services coverage on networking solutions for enterprises (i.e. cloud VPN, accelerators, cloud SD-WAN, IoT, private LTE/5G, and multi-vendor network orchestration).Webscale players’ forays into such networking and telco solutions are mainly driven by the promise of 5G. When I speak to customers and others in the industry , it is widely believed that the next battleground for webscale players is 5G. For example, Microsoft recently made their intentions clear with their acquisitions of Affirmed (vEPC, 5gc) and Metaswitch (vIMS). Google Cloud Platform announced their three-pronged telco strategy that focuses on monetising 5G edge computing solutions, reimagining the customer journey with data and AI, and subsequently helping operators improve internal operations efficiencies. Google Cloud Platform is also extending their Anthos hybrid multi-could platform to support telecom operators Telecom operators in India have also started their own ‘telco cloud’ journey. Although these efforts initially were started to support their own internal network function virtualisation (NFV) initiatives, these operators now see a big opportunity to play a critical role in the delivery of cloud services in India as well.As digital services for various vertical markets expand with applications where latency becomes critical for cloud computing services, it is only logical to also bring compute closer to where the data is generated. Hence we’re seeing a surge in interest for edge computing across the world, including in India. India’s leading ‘edge use cases’ are likely to be media processing, telemedicine, video surveillance, manufacturing, and a myriad of immersive applications such as AR/VR and gaming.All three leading webscale players have launched their edge solutions – Azure Stack; AWS Outpost, Wavelength, Local Zone; Google Anthos – which cover on-premises colocations with telecom operators and private zones. It is expected that many of these edge offerings could be commercially launched soon in India in partnerships with telecom operators.Telecom operators are expected to enter into strategic partnerships with multiple webscale players. For these operators to deliver the low-latency services promised by 5G and edge computing, close partnerships with the webscale players will be needed, so they can monetise ‘connectivity’ as a platform to broaden and enhance their competitive advantage.Despite massive capital investments in 3G and 4G, pressures on average revenue per user have resulted in no meaningful profitability returns to date. 3G and 4G deployments in India have instead been more about capturing and holding onto market share to later monetise. Fortunately, 5G promises to deliver more than just higher speed connectivity. This is pushing telecom operators towards reinvigorating a ‘platform economy’ for the business ecosystem, to better monetise their investments. Bundling of services has not proven profitable during 3G and 4G eras, so rather than pursuing that as a strategy, you will see telecom service providers offering differentiated 5G services priced at different levels.According to Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2019 by Stanford University, insatiable demands from both consumer and business sectors are doubling “compute” requirements in less than every 4 months. Therefore, compute processing and storage capacity can no longer keep up with Moore’s Law. Amidst this growth, ‘Connect Networks’ are expected to play a more critical role than ever before to efficiently use compute processing resources. For example, tightly coupled distributed computing across a set of edge data centers in the metro network, with well-engineered connectivity, has the promise to deliver ‘fungible pools of distributed cloud computing’ to meet webscale players’ edge cloud service capacity and performance metrics. This is good news for telecom operators, who can now enable the right type of connectivity for edge cloud service needs.Telecom operators have a great opportunity to put their strengths to work by monetizing quality of experience in ‘connect platforms’ by way of Network Slicing, coupled with new consumption and charging models.While the concept behind network slicing is not new, it is to be understood as the ability to custom fit network connectivity to application needs over a common shared network. Recent technical advancements – specifically the advent of Segment Routing (SR), cloud-based controllers and open platforms with APIs for webscale players and application providers to collaborate in a business ecosystem – have made mass implementations of network slicing possible. For example, currently, a service provider might approach monetization as a single connectivity model simply based on speed, up-time, or both. In the future, this same service provider could enable a matrix of API driven platform slices to meet a few different application requirements and target quality of experience.

"Cloud computing is a top workforce skill sought by companies.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Educate, in a new initiative will be providing a curriculum to seven universities in India for cloud computing in their mainstream college syllabus. The aim is to help the next generation of cloud computing professionals. According to a press note released by the company, the offered course will be a part of undergraduate degree and postgraduate diploma programs which will start this year in September.

It is to note that AWS Educate is Amazon’s global initiative that helps provide students comprehensive resources in order to build skills required for the cloud.

The education institutions that will offer the newly-designed curriculum are Chitkara University in Punjab, Galgotias University and Institute of Engineering and Technology in Uttar Pradesh, Manav Rachna University and Sharda University in Delhi- NCR, and SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Tamil Nadu. “The ASM Group of Institutes in Maharashtra will offer syllabus combined with the AWS Educate cloud curricula for its Post Graduate Diploma in Management – Emerging Technology,” the company said.

"With the novel coronavirus COVID-19 sweeping across continents and fatalities climbing every day, it was only a matter of time before countries closed their borders to contain its spread. In the wake of this decision, travel and tourism, the linchpins of many economies, were among the worst affected. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the COVID-19 pandemic caused a 22 percent fall in international tourist arrivals during the first quarter of 2020, and could see an annual decline of between 60 percent and 80 percent when compared with 2019. The impact on the economy and to livelihoods that are dependent on tourism and hospitality has been significant.





Prior to the pandemic, the outlook was quite different. Research by UNWTO in 2018 estimated that India would have 50 million outbound tourists by 2020. Technology was also set to play a huge part in that growth. A Google Travel study showed that 74 percent of travellers were planning their trips on the Internet, and technologies like AI, IoT and VR were all set to be key trends this year.





Now, as borders slowly reopen and travel restrictions are gradually lifted, technology could once again be the game-changer. Manoj Sharma CTO, Cleartrip.com spoke to YourStory about the industry’s road to recovery and how technology will aid that journey.

Delivering convenience and safety first

In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak, there was a significant rise in cancellations on the platform. The Cleartrip team assembled a team of engineers and built and deployed solutions to help customers manage their own cancellations using a non-voice model. Manoj says this helped them take charge of their own itineraries and efficiently and conveniently manage their changing requirements.





However, with the easing of the lockdown, people are now slowly returning to travel, and their primary concern is safety.





“We launched several products like Travel Safe quite early on, which provides travellers with information about travel safety and rules and regulations for specific regions, airlines, airports, etc,” he says.

Creating custom experiences

One of the other fallouts of the pandemic was a sudden overload of information on how it would affect travel. There was an urgent need to educate the customer with relevant filtered information. “Travel Safe addressed this requirement at the pre-booking stage, and the feedback from our users was really positive. We also leveraged our data technologies to build products that would enhance flexibility in terms of pricing and trip planning at the booking stage to give customers an itinerary that was best suited for their needs.”





The Cleartrip team uses proprietary data algorithms and data analytics to understand customer behaviour and predict their needs. “Being on the Google Cloud Platform really helped us develop the necessary insights quickly, which shaped the various products that we are developing,” says Manoj.

Scaling on the Cloud

Cleartrip India recently completed its transition to Google Cloud. Manoj says that the team from Google were very responsive and supportive when it came to understanding their needs and creating solutions that catered to their requirements and were easy to implement.





“We were looking for a partner whose solutions aligned with our technology stack. Our other criteria were infrastructure integration, efficiencies, and a partnership approach. Factors such as reliability, scale, performance, were a given, and I have to say that Google Cloud has ticked all of those checkboxes for us,” says Manoj explaining why they chose Google Cloud as their technology partner.

Manoj and his team started engaging with the Google Cloud team early in their search for a cloud solution. He says that it was the latter’s willingness to understand their unique needs, and then recommend appropriate solutions that made them the ideal partner.





“We have seen a significant improvement (66 percent) in the reliability, and in the efficiency of our infrastructure. Our improved ability to scale up and down has helped us provide much better caching utilization, and remove some of the inefficiencies that we previously had in our systems. This has also improved our SLAs with global partners,” says Manoj explaining how the partnership with Google Cloud has aided them.

He adds that since Cleartrip has a significant B2B offering with customers in India and across the globe, a more reliable infrastructure has given them the confidence to better meet SLAs.





Future scope

Speaking about the technologies that they plan to use in the future, Manoj says, “While we are currently using BigQuery, going forward, we are looking at using Auto ML, and TensorFlow. Apart from that, we are also strengthening security and seeing how we can leverage Google's global presence to aid our disaster recovery solutions.”





As an online business, Cleatrip.com is highly reliant on technology to deliver value to its customers.





“We are building teams that are independent end-to-end and can deliver both growth and innovation via our products. We feel that Google Cloud is an ideal partner, as our engineering teams can now focus on developing products that bring value to the business, and not worry about the operational challenges of managing infrastructure,” he adds.

Addressing the future of travel, Manoj says that while the travel industry has been significantly impacted by the pandemic, they are optimistic about recovery as they believe there is a pent up demand for travel. “Consumers are reluctant or hesitant to travel currently because of the uncertainty and their need for safety. We certainly feel that as companies start to address these needs, traveller confidence will return.”",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",YourStory.com,How Cleartrip.com is leveraging Google Cloud to survive the slump in the travel industry,https://yourstory.com/2020/07/cleartrip-leveraging-google-cloud-travel-industry
"This internet boom over the last two has led to the growth in the demand for bandwidth from data centres. Lack of access to quality data networks and fully amped data centres in India is truly felt among organisations during this novel Coronavirus pandemic. To counter the pressure of work from home scenarios, Indian organisations are investing many times more than traditional IT spending in cloud infrastructure. In addition, cloud companies are expanding fast in the nation.

Even global companies are flocking towards India. For instance, Oracle has come up with its second cloud region in Hyderabad to support customers’ demand for enterprise cloud services in India. The launch follows the launch of its Mumbai Cloud region in 2019, making India Oracle’s latest nation with multiple cloud regions available. India has also become the next big hot market for internet giants such as Netflix, Spotify, Facebook and Amazon, fuelling demand for cloud professionals who could manage the digital infrastructure.

Amid this boom, training providers are witnessing a surge in enrolment in their information technology training programmes, including emerging technologies like cloud and data science. The jobs of the future will need expertise specific niche skills, and upskilling is the only way for a long term career growth for technologists. Hence certification programs are getting popularity among the IT professionals. According to analysts, COVID-19 lockdown has catalysed the enthusiasm of techies to getting certified. Indian software programmers are going for cloud certifications amidst COVID-19 lockdown, revealed a survey report from TechGig.

Techies Know Cloud Certifications Help Boost Careers

Extensive understanding of a new-age technology appeared the most crucial reason for techies to take certifications. Also, freshers and new joiners are more interested in acquiring certifications than working professionals. Cloud technology – which is helping communication and remote working amid the present COVID-19 lockdown – is also the preferred option for upskilling for the Indian developers, notes TechGig. The preference for cloud came on top of other advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.

“In today’s unique COVID-19 time, technology is the only string which is keeping the world together. From cloud computing, which is supporting work-from-home to artificial intelligence, which is backing banking, retail, and important sectors run operations. Besides, cloud computing is crucial for robotics that is helping the front-line hospital personnel; new-age technologies are assisting the globe to connect in the existing time. The TechGig survey shows the enthusiasm of Indian developers to upskill on these new-age technologies,” said Sanjay Goyal, Vice President & Head of Product and Technology at TechGig

Looking for people with cloud skills is a complex endeavour. Organisations these days are finding it very difficult to hire and retain cloud specialists, particularly in roles requiring advanced cloud skills and cloud architecture. Therefore, companies are giving due importance to both finding and creating the skills in-house so they do not face infrastructure challenges. Also, given the introduction of new services from the three major cloud platforms – Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and others, cloud training has to be constant so people can stay on top of the technology. Training providers are witnessing a surge in enrolment in their information technology training programmes, including emerging technologies like cloud and data science.

Cloud technology is one of the leading tech domains for upskilling among the techies and other technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing, getting the highest preference in terms of the need for upskilling. According to TechGig ‘IT Certification Survey,’ one of the most important findings was that 90% of the respondents revealed that they are planning to have an IT certification soon to support and boost their career prospects. That’s why the adoption of certification courses is on the rise.

Why Cloud Skills Are Hot Among IT Workers

Cloud computing has risen to be the most sought-after skills set in the world for the last few years, and in particular, in 2020, companies are migrating their infrastructure and apps to cloud platforms. As a consequence, cloud jobs are also growing at a swift pace, making it one of the hottest fields in information technology. Now, with the demand for cloud experts, it has fuelled the need for niche skills, and IT professionals know that well.

It is clear that IT professionals will not face any issue with employment opportunities if they are skilled in cloud technologies space, particularly for platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure. Consequently, learners are developing skills so they can grab the jobs as a cloud developer/administrator or system operators for cloud platforms after finishing their training programs. The platforms are utilised by thousands and thousands of businesses worldwide for hosting their products and services.

Cloud training courses will provide professionals with the opportunity to learn the best techniques and practices in cloud computing and acquire live feedback from an expert instructor. Training will help learners to take cloud certification exams from vendors- AWS, Azure or Oracle certifications to get recognised by hiring managers.

The upskilling is spread across advanced classroom training programs run by specialised institutes like Jigsaw Academy and Great Learning, etc, which have also witnessed a surge in demand for enrollment. Apart from training institutes, learners are also flocking to cheaper and/or free courses from cloud vendors or those found on Udemy. In fact, in a recent survey done by Analytics India Magazine, 76.9% of the analytics professionals are spending their time on training through self-learning.

While IT professionals not already working with cloud technologies will gain a solid foundation, those with some cloud experience will gain a more structured and hands-on understanding of cloud technologies, including issues such as migration, deployment, integration, platform choice, and architecture.

According to reports, COVID-19 pandemic has caused the desire to get certified, and professionals understand that certification is a need of the hour amid mass layoffs. DevOps, infrastructure-as-a-service, software-as-a-service, automation, agile and software-defined networks are going to be critical for IT professionals to land these jobs. Some platforms are offering interesting courses for learners to build their cloud tech skills, including many free courses to build cloud tech skills.

"by Gautam Chikermane, Observer Research Foundation

This text has been excerpted from the Observer Research Foundation with permission. Read the full paper here.

The evolution from 0G to 5G has been a trajectory of technology as much as of applications and consumer empowerment. Based on a timeline provided by Firooz B. Saghezchi et al.,[2] the technology of telecommunications has generally advanced every four to 14 years: seven years from 1G to 2G, five years from 2G to 2.5G, four years from 2.5G to 3G and 14 years from 3G to 4G. It is estimated that the shift from 4G to 5G should take approximately eight years, and 5G will be ubiquitous across the world by 2021. The shift from 4G to 5G is not merely about the speed of downloads, though speed is an essential component of what it can deliver. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU),[3] the framework for the development of the International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT) 2020 standards takes 5G into account, with a spectrum efficiency that is expected to be three times higher (with very low over-the-air latency) and will support high-speed trains or Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) scenarios,[4] characterised by a large number of connected devices transmitting relatively low volume of non-delay sensitive data, useful to cover IoT, smart agriculture, smart cities, energy monitoring, smart home and remote monitoring.[5]

However, it is what 5G enables that makes the technology as lethal to its users as it is beneficial. In the near future, 5G is set to become the backbone of smart cities and IoT. Through enhanced mobile broadband, the technology can deliver augmented- and virtual-reality functionality. It can enable climate-smart agriculture, smart cities and smart homes through MMTC. It can drive autonomous vehicles, smart grids, remote patient monitoring and telehealth, and industrial automation through ultra-reliable and low-latency communications,[6] all of which depend on the ability of 5G technology to support, link and power the IoT. The IoT has been defined by D. Minoli and B. Occhiogrosso:[7]

“The basic concept of IoT is to enable objects of all kinds to have sensing, actuating, and communication capabilities, so that locally-intrinsic or extrinsic data can be collected, processed, transmitted, concentrated, and analysed for either cyber-physical goals at the collection point (or perhaps along the way), or for process/environment/systems analytics (of predictive or historical nature) at a processing centre, often ‘on the cloud’. Applications range from infrastructure and critical-infrastructure support (for example smart grid, smart city, smart building, and transportation), to end-user applications such as e-health, crowdsensing, and further along, to a multitude of other applications where only the imagination is the limit. Some refer to the field as ‘connected technology’. While the reach of IoT is (expected to be, or become) all-encompassing, a more well-established subset deals with Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, where some architectural constructs and specific Use Cases have already been defined by the standardisation community.”

According to Saghezchi et al., 5G technology is still evolving:[8]

“5G is still to be defined officially by standardisation bodies. It will be a system of super high‐capacity and ultra‐high‐speed data with new design requirements tailored towards energy elicited systems and reduced operational expenditure for operators. In this context, 5G envisages not only one invented technology, but a technology ecosystem of wireless networks working in synergy to provide a seamless communication medium to the end user. Thus, we can say that moving from 4G to 5G means a shift in design paradigm from a single‐discipline system to a multi‐discipline system.”

What is this ecosystem? The complexity of 5G technology is such that it needs highly specialised world-class expertise and equipment for its various components. Huawei, for example, procures only some components from its home country, China. These include cameras, laser amplifiers and batteries. It sources antennas, data storage, modems, software and licences from the US; semi-conductors from Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland or Taiwan; and memory cards and display panels from Japan. Since the US placed a ban on doing business with Huawei, the company has had to look elsewhere to source several essential components.[9]

Of significance here is the fact that the intricacy of 5G technology requires equipment providers to source components from a variety of countries and companies (as Huawei does), and these sources include Chinese manufacturers. Thus, even if India were to ban Huawei or Chinese firms for 5G, some Chinese components may still find their way into the Indian market through other vendors. For example, radar sensors are an important component for remote medical diagnosis and surgery, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication for self-driving cars, smart transportation and smart industry. This is a market that Huawei is attempting to enter,[10] and its ecosystem comprises chip designers, component manufacturers, technology providers and system integrators. Companies that make them are spread across Germany, Japan, UK, Netherlands, the US and Sweden. The job of radar-sensor manufacturers, therefore, involves getting the best components from across the world and assembling them. The question that arises then is this: What will be the effective ‘country of origin’ of such a product that, like an Apple iPhone, may have components from companies from all over the world? Conversely, what is the guarantee that 5G equipment from Sweden’s Ericsson, South Korea’s Samsung, Finland’s Nokia or the US’ Cisco will not carry components from China’s Huawei or ZTE? One way forward is to simply rely on the fact that the final assembling, and thus the control and accountability, will be in the hands of a non-Chinese firm and therefore subjected to democratic scrutiny and justice, not to the whims of an authoritarian China.

As a critical telecommunications infrastructure that is global, 5G can deliver a boundless, high-speed, reliable and secure broadband experience; create innovative future networks; provide the networks and platforms to drive the digitisation and automation of industrial practices and processes (including the 4IR); and power the IoT and critical communications services.[11] It can also bring societal changes—individual, corporate, regulatory and governmental. 5G will be to the 21st century what computers and satellites were to the 20th century and steam engines to the 19th century. Through IoT, this technology is expected to fundamentally transform the role that telecommunications plays in our lives, not only delivering a future where all people are connected to one another, but also creating a society where everything and everyone is connected.[12]

While the benefits of 5G are unimaginable, those driving the technology can also wreak havoc that on governments, citizens, financial flows and businesses, at a scale unprecedented and through an intrusion unmatched. In light of this, to hand this infrastructure to a foreign company (Huawei) that is bound by law (See Section 3) to support its nation of origin (China) on matters of intelligence-gathering is to expose India to tremendous risk.

Imagine the potential destruction if self-driven cars are sent distorted signals, long-distance operations sent incorrect images, traffic lights in smart cities manipulated to create accidents, communications infrastructure for airlines or railways disrupted, business secrets of rival firms culled out, fake news narratives created. Above all, imagine the possibility of injecting spyware into the security infrastructure or into financial systems of stock, currency or commodity exchanges, all of which would be acts of war. In repeated tensions along borders or in support of Pakistan’s terror, any or all of these would be tools in the hand of the Chinese government to destabilise India and its national interests.

No government, no political party, no regulatory structure and no security system the world over can accept this level of risk for its citizens. Preventing the entry of Huawei can be visualised as a technological policy vaccination.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",MediaNama.com,Protecting 5G and IoT from foreign state interference,https://www.medianama.com/2020/07/223-5g-iot-india-huawei/

The COVID-19 is deeply impacting the Indian Economy with an increased number of infected cases being reported every day and flattening of curve still at least a month away according to sector experts.

Recently, Indian Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi in his speech to the nation advised the country to become “Aatmanirbhar” or self-reliant, so dependency on other countries for essential and non-essential goods are minimized.

We believe one of the first sectors that will strive to become self-reliant is technology as many of the best resources in the world are already in India and with a good ecosystem of engineering institutes, top tech companies already present and keen interest in young Indian students in science and technology.

We have been witnessing a wave of fast adoption of smart connected products like Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled gadgets, smart lighting, smart homes and smart logistics etc. Indian tech companies in the space of the Internet of Things (IoT) are ramping up their business plans to take advantage of the support provided by the Indian government.

IOT has become a recent buzzword across the globe and soon it is supposed to outnumber the cellular communication devices across the world, and when this happens anything and everything is supposed to communicate to the user or enterprises through cloud.

Many Indian companies are working in the first phase of the deployment which is to deliver a monitoring capability over the network and once they have enough data, then predictive analysis can be made.

Few Indian IoT and data science companies are entering into IoT business to take care of the communication part of the overall ecosystem which includes every commercially available and viable technology whether it Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) Wi-Fi, GSM, Narrowband IoT, LORA or SIGFOX etc.

The idea is to create and sustain a local homegrown ecosystem with local design, production and local consumption by offering customised applications and support to small and mid-tier customers.

The current situation demands it more than ever now as we have created larger dependencies on external sources for most of our electronics (design and manufacturing) needs. With this renewed emphasis on Make in India products, IoT can play a perfect pivot for Indian AI, Data Science, Machine Learning to drive the next Indian tech growth for IoT.

"ST to Strengthen MCU Portfolio via Acquisitions

Article By : Nitin Dahad

The company shored up its wireless connectivity options for its microcontroller line by buying UWB and cellular IoT companies...

STMicroelectronics today announced two separate deals, one to acquire ultra-wideband (UWB) technology specialist BeSpoon and the other to buy the assets of Riot Micro, which was developing cellular Internet of things (IoT) connectivity. With the acquisitions, ST aims to strengthen its wireless connectivity capabilities, especially in support of its STM32 microcontrollers and secure MCUs.

BeSpoon, based in Le Bourget du Lac, France, is a fabless semiconductor company, founded in 2010, that specializes in UWB communications technology, developed over time in partnership with CEA-Leti in Grenoble, France. At CES in Las Vegas in 2014, BeSpoon showed a smartphone concept equipped with UWB, called the SpoonPhone.

The technology gradually evolved and BeSpoon is now focused on enabling live location data in Industry 4.0 applications. The company supports the omlox standard, an open and interoperable networking standard for real-time location in smart factories. With omlox, products from different manufacturers can be networked together in a core zone and various locating technologies (including UWB, Wi-Fi, GPS, 5G, RFID, and BLE) can be easily connected.

Now, its technology enables secure real-time indoor location with centimeter accuracy under adverse environmental conditions. ST said the integration of this key secure positioning technology in the STM32 product portfolio will enable developers of IoT, automotive and mobile communication applications to provide services such as secure access, and precise indoor and outdoor mapping.

ST will acquire BeSpoon from its majority shareholder, Trumpf, and from its founders. In parallel with the transaction, ST and Trumpf will enter into a strategic partnership for UWB tracking technology. Trumpf, a provider of machine tools and lasers for industrial manufacturing, was behind the launch of omlox as a universal interface for many connectivity technologies, with around 60 partners last month. The standard is being promoted now by Profibus, a global industrial standards organization.

Cellular IoT

Riot Micro, based in Vancouver, Canada, designs cellular IoT solutions, borrowing design techniques from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi to LTE Cat-M and NB-IoT to optimize system cost and power. The integration of cellular communication capabilities into the STM32 portfolio will strengthen ST’s offer for customers developing applications such as asset tracking, metering, and fleet management services.

Riot Micro was established as Wimatek Systems in 2007 and then changed to its current name in 2014. Its RM1000 baseband modem chip for cellular IoT utilizes BLE and Wi-Fi architecture techniques to deliver cellular IoT with the low power and cost characteristics of short-range wireless systems. The device is a dual-mode LTE-M / NB-IoT cellular baseband with integrated SRAM and full software stack comprising LTE L2/L3, AT Command stack, and TCP/UDP/IP stack.

While ST already had worked with BeSpoon, we asked what led to the choice of Riot Micro. A spokesperson told EE Times, “ST chose them because their staff is made of senior specialists with expertise in telecommunication products covering signal processing, protocol stack and RF. Together, they have used a development methodology similar to the ones that have been used for optimized Bluetooth Low Energy solutions. This approach results in a much-optimized modem with improved area, power consumption and SW stack memory footprint. Riot has the full ownership of the hardware and software modem technology including protocol stack and applicative layers covers LTE CAT M and NB-IoT protocols.”

We also asked about the timescales and when we’d see STM32 MCUs with these new connectivity options integrated. The spokesperson told us, “We’ve not yet released our product roadmaps for the integration of technology from Riot Micro or for BeSpoon, but this information will be disclosed soon.”

"As the world grapples with a new way of life and the COVID-19 crisis peaks, its impact on everyone’s mental and physical health is indescribable.





The pandemic is not only creating a major impact on the global economy, it is also helping to accelerate the development and commercialisation of several emerging technologies that previously received lukewarm consumer response. This is predominantly accurate for innovations that reduce human-to-human contact, automate processes, and increase productivity amid social distancing.









With Artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) rapidly gaining ground in varying forms and degrees, the use of these innovation has begun to appear in a wide spectrum of technologies - from the phones we use to communicate to the supply chains that bring goods to market. It is modifying the way we interact, consume information, and obtain goods and services.





Healthcare is no exception to this new disruption. In the medical industry, the impact of AI, IoT, and other technologies through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), is transforming care delivery.





Data suggests that AI simplifies the lives of patients, doctors, and hospital administrators by performing tasks that are typically done by humans, but in less time and at a fraction of the cost.





It allows patients to track their ultrasounds, thermometers, glucose monitors, electrocardiograms, etc., by being connected through technologies like AI and IoT. These are reinventing and reinvigorating modern healthcare through machines that can predict, comprehend, learn, and act.





A major trend in medicine, when it comes to AI, is using deep learning in medical diagnosis to detect cancer. A recent study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute shows that the AI system has achieved a breast cancer detection accuracy comparable to an average breast radiologist.





With the ability of AI networks to train radiologists, there are chances that their performance will be significantly improved in the nearest future.





Another promising implementation is the use of AI and the Internet of Medical Things in consumer health applications, which allows them to gather healthcare data and process the information and offer adjustments to the current lifestyle of a patient.





Its major purpose is to improve the hospital room experience and simplify the process of preparing patients to continue their healing at home. Also, virtual nurses reduce patient anxiety, improve safety, keep people entertained, and increase patient satisfaction with medical services.





When it comes to medical diagnosis, doctors have seen that applying AI & IoT to medical diagnosis provides numerous benefits to the healthcare industry. AI and IoT based software can tell whether a patient has a certain disease even before evident symptoms appear.





But what AI is extensively helping doctors in is the ease that it is providing in classifying diseases. With deep learning technologies that analyse images and recognise patterns, it is creating a huge potential in generating algorithms that are helping healthcare officials in diagnosing diseases faster.





Moreover, research suggests that AI-driven software can be programmed to accurately spot signs of a certain disease in medical images such as MRIs, X-rays, and CT scans. Existing similar solutions already use AI for cancer diagnosis by processing photos of skin lesions.





By using such tools, doctors are able to diagnose patients more accurately and prescribe the most suitable treatment for them at an earlier stage, resulting in increasing the chances of cancer prevention.





Henceforth, we can say that from patient and self-service to chatbots, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for diagnosis, and image data analysis to identify candidate molecules in drug discovery, AI, IoT and other technologies are already at work.





They are swiftly helping in increasing convenience and efficiency, reducing costs and errors, and generally making it easier for more patients to receive the healthcare they need. While each technology can contribute significant value alone, the larger potential lies in the synergies generated by using them together across the entire patient journey, from diagnoses to treatment, to ongoing health maintenance.

It can easily be said that AI and IoT solutions can lead to better care outcomes and improve the productivity and efficiency of care delivery. They can also improve the day-to-day life of healthcare practitioners, letting them spend more time looking after patients, and in doing so, raise staff morale and improve retention.





It can even offer life-saving treatments to markets faster. With the increased use of AI and IoT in healthcare, it will certainly influence the types of new entrants into the healthcare industry as well as influence how providers, clinicians, and other staff will work in the future.





In India, the last five years have seen consumer-facing ‘health tech’ being talked about and embraced by investors, government, and gradually by the public. Among educated consumers in urban areas, technology is largely gaining traction through online health service aggregators, telemedicine, e-pharmacies, and a few fitness apps. Existing methods are also being used to reinvent healthcare delivery in the form of online consults or chat-based basic healthcare service apps, especially during these unprecedented times.





From a social viewpoint, building greater trust in AI and protecting personal healthcare data will continue to be among the universal challenges. From an administrative standpoint, making it easier for AI to integrate with existing technology infrastructure will certainly help adoption.





For our country, we can conclude that these advanced technologies in healthcare are helping expand the human capacity rather than replacing human labour altogether. Putting us in a unique position to be the driver for AI and IoT technologies in healthcare space for national and international companies.





With large amounts of data and a burgeoning startup community, India has the opportunity to address many healthcare-related problems by using them. With new disruptions in healthcare innovations, we will soon be in a position to realise the benefits of these technologies on health outcomes.





Irrespective of a patient’s location or condition, an evolution of the AI, IoT, IoMT ecosystem will become progressively impactful. And even the most remote locations will benefit from better access to care as connected medical devices continue to find their way into the hands of both patients and clinicians.





Connected health and Artificial intelligence in healthcare is no more a thing of the future, it is slowly transforming the ‘now’ that we are living in.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",YourStory.com,Here’s how connected health and artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare industry,https://yourstory.com/2020/07/connected-health-artificial-intelligence-healthcare-industry

Sangarmesh Talikotti has been a farmer for 20 years and is well aware of the unpredictable factors that can affect his livelihood each season. The 40-year-old also knows that he has to use a mix of the traditional knowledge acquired over the years and modern methods to minimise the risks he faces every season. So when he heard about deploying internet of things ( IoT ) technology in farming, Talikotti did not hesitate. In March, he spentRs 38,000 to plant three sensors on his 2.5-acre tomato farm.The artificial intelligence-driven platform from Benguluru-based agri-tech startup Fasal regularly relays information to Talikotti’s smartphone. He gets updates on when to irrigate the field, when to reap the crops, what is the risk of pest attack and where to use pesticides. Talikotti is so impressed with the system that he now intends to install sensors across his 60-acre farm where he grows papayas, brinjals and drumsticks. He is especially happy that his fate is not entirely based on the variables anymore, all thanks to Fasal.The startup, which has 30 employees, “tries to take the guesswork out of farming,” says Ananda Verma, founder & CEO. “We are a precision agriculture company with a focus on horticulture.” Using software engineers, pathologists, horticulture experts and AI experts, startups like Fasal, AgSmartic, CropIn and others collect farm data, analyse these and present helpful and remedial information to farmers. Hemant Wavhal, 35, is happy that he gave FasalRs 47,000 in February to deploy sensors on his two-acre pomegranate farm at Alephata village in Pune district. He claims to have already saved around Rs 30,000 on plant protection chemicals as the sensors pinpoint where to spray the chemical.Technology is beneficial for farmers looking to minimise risks and increase output. Talikotti and Wavhal will vouch for that. They are among a small but increasing number of agrarians employing technology to take the guesswork out of their profession. This has, in turn, birthed an ecosystem of small and big companies trying to bring about smart transformations in farming.Basically, sensors collect temperature, light, Ph values, moisture content and other such readings. Some sensors are deployed about 18 inches below the soil to collect microclimatic readings and soil data. IoT converts these data into precise actionable intelligence for farmers. And these companies are collecting and analysing that data to help farmers.The ecosystem can help the government achieve its goal of doubling farm income by 2022. It can also power the rural economy, seen as an important engine that will propel India towards its goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025, from $2.7 trillion now.These goals can be easily achieved if farming gets a tech upgrade. Harsha Razdan, partner & head of consumer markets & retail, KPMG India, says, “Low spending on R&D, low productivity and small farm holdings are the problems. These conditions are fertile for technology providers to disrupt the sector and improve yields.”R&D spend on agriculture as a percentage of GDP is only 0.7% in India, according to the Economic Survey 2020. It is 2.8% in the US, 2.1% in China and 4.2% in Israel. Even farm mechanisation is low in India, at 40%, when compared with 60% in China and 75% in Brazil.Not surprisingly, tech companies and startups see an opportunity to upgrade the around $400 billion Indian agriculture sector. There are 896 agri-tech startups providing tech tools for pre-harvest, post-harvest and during plant-growing periods, according to Tracxn data as on July 1. They have attracted $560 million of venture funding, most of it in the last three years. In two years, according to Maple Capital Advisors, agri-tech ventures will attract another $500 million.With that kind of potential, former investment banker Taranjeet Singh Bhamra had no trouble in deciding to start AgNext in 2016. The Chandigarh-based startup uses computer vision and spectroscopy for post-harvest inspection of tea leaves. “About $3 billion worth of tea trade happens annually via visual inspection -- by keeping a few leaves on the ground and deciding on the quality of tea. We built a technology that analyses the leaves by checking the fibre content,” says Singh. It took AgNext 18 months and half a billion leaves to develop an algorithm to detect the quality of tea leaves more quickly and effectively.Technology is also being used to scale up vegetables cultivation. Take, for instance, potatoes, which get destroyed by early-morning frost. Farmers generally leave water pumps on through the night as wet soil offers better protection from frost. But too much water can also be harmful. There is help at hand now as sensors can predict when there is a chance of frost and decide if the irrigation system should be switched on. CropIn, which gives agri-tech solutions to brinjal, tomato and onion farmers in Jharkhand and Orissa, claims to have helped its partners increase productivity by around 30% over the last three years by providing such information.“IoT and agriculture are tied to each other,” says Alok Bardiya, head of IoT, Tata Communications, which had rolled out a low-power wide-area network protocol in India in 2017. This basically allows long-range transmission of data using less power, making it suitable to connect sensors deployed over a vast area. This data from the ground makes sense for farming only when juxtaposed with satellite data, which is collected by companies such as SatSure. “We look for proxy indicators,” says Prateep Basu, a former ISRO scientist who started SatSure in 2016. “For example, water in soil has a different signal than just soil. We can predict droughts using such technology.”The most challenging aspect of agri-tech ventures will be understanding the vagaries of monsoon . Skymet Weather Services, India’s first private weather forecaster, understands how testing that can be. It has 7,500 sensors and 100 crop cameras across the country collecting data, which is used to create actionable information.“Technology can help agriculture by minimising weather risks, pest risks and input risks,” says Jatin Singh, CEO of Skymet. Sensors and cameras can keep tabs on pheromone traps and relay relevant information to farmers. Noida-based AgSmartic Technologies uses autonomous systems to provide early pest detection warning. Abhishek Sinha, CEO & cofounder, says the company has deployed sensors on 570 acres of farms at three locations in Punjab.Apart from acting as a pest monitoring system, these also collect soil temperature and moisture levels. This information can show stress in water demand, which can trigger autonomous irrigation. Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy officer of Tech Mahindra, says, “Cre-ation of an agri stack which will connect all stakeholders across the ecosystem is the next logical step.” As companies harness technology to do more with less, some startups are offering a way to grow vegetables without soil.Chennai-based Aqua Farms, for one, hydroponic home kits that are plug-and-play solutions to grow leafy greens. The kit comprises a nutrient filling technology and costs Rs 6,000-45,000 for output of 2-20 per month. Since starting the sales in January 2019, the company has sold 1,000 kits across India. This trend could pick up as cities are built and people opt for home-vegetables. The technique could find more land-scarce urban hubs.\Hyderabad-based UrbanKisaan uses hydroponics to grow vegetables at a commercial scale. Started in 2017, UrbanKisaan grows 70 varieties of crops, including tomatoes, potatoes and onions, in indoor farms that are no more than 2,500 sq feet. “We grow 30x more vegetables than what can be done in soil farming, using 95% less water. 2,000 sq feet equals 2 acres of farm output,” says Vihari Kanukollu, CEO & cofounder, UrbanKisaan, which sells its produce online. As indoor farming tries to mimic the outdoor environment, the reliance on tech gets higher. Sensors continuously monitor temperature, moisture and humidity, among others.Tech is especially useful in these closed and confined settings. Another system being deployed is aquaponics, which uses nutrientrich water from fish tanks to feed vegetables before circulating the water back into the fish tanks. Here, again, technology has made the technique sustainable. If the Ph levels in water is high, plants will die. If it falls, fish will perish. So there is heavy dependence on sensors and IoT to maintain the right balance in the ecosystem.Anubhav Das, 46, became so fascinated by this system that he decided to plunge into it, despite having worked as a photographer and brand strategist for almost two decades.After learning aquaponics system design at the Aquaponics Institute of Australia in Melbourne, he set up Red Otter Farms on an acre close to Nanital in Uttarakhand. “There is consistency in quality of the output, soil contaminants are removed and there are no impurities.” He grows lettuce, kale, rocket leaves, swiss chard, arugula and other leafy greens and sells them directly to at least 100 subscribers in the Delhi-NCR region. Despite agri-tech having many benefits, issues like erratic network and high costs could slow the rate of adoption.Besides farmers have to see savings and growth in their incomes before they decide to go all in -- which would be easier said than done in a country where they still face economic hardship regularly.But if a concerted push from the government and the companies succeeds in ensuring a wider adoption of agri-tech, farms in India can become more profitable in three to five years. Even if monsoon threatens to hurt farmers, data from clouds could save them.There are 146 million farms. How many have adopted technology? These are interesting showpieces. Unless there is money for farmers, these technologies will not scale up. These are experiments. Out of 100 startups, not even 10 scale up. Technologies bring revolution only when there is profit for farmers.Who will bear the cost of digital technologies, including AI, IoT and ML, is the issue. The government can’t give subsidy for everything.The question is, is the customer ready to pay for it? The whole process has to start at the farmers’ level. Aggregation has to be done: let 50 farmers come together, let them wash, dry, put barcodes on produce to identify which place it has come from for traceability. Then it should be graded in terms of quality — A, B, C. Are we getting that type of thing?These have not scaled in India. Will customers be ready to pay, say, Rs 200 for a kilo of cherry tomatoes from hydroponics, when regular farm tomatoes are available for Rs 40 a kg? In the last three months, tomato prices have fluctuated — from Rs 12 per kg to Rs 80 per kg (at Azadpur market in Delhi). How will farmers recover costs in technology when there are such wild price fluctuations? The question is, when tech comes from lab to land, what is the cost involved and what is the price farmers will get for the output? Farmers says, ‘the more I produce, the less I get’ — they are unable to recover their costs.There is no dearth of technology to increase production. We have to look at where it will be absorbed and at what price. Recently, in Rajasthan, farmers blocked a road in Jaipur because mustard price was 25% below MSP. Unless you can ensure profitable cultivation, technologies can never take off. And you can’t run it on a subsidy model.Digitisation tools are cutting down costs. But give farmers a costbenefit analysis. Just showing that a tool can increase productivity by 20-30% is not enough. Show when cost will go down and profits will go up 10%, or 20%, or 30%.If you plan to double the output in the next 5-10 years, you can do it. If the market collapses (due to oversupply) and farmers can’t recover the cost, then forget it. Focus on developing the market. Create demand. Otherwise, these are white elephants. I am not totally against tech — but 90% of tech focusses on production and that is where the problem starts. If you look at the history of revolutions — green, white or poultry — there were markets for them.There are broadly three kinds of technologies: for seeds and nutrients; machine technology like tractors, irrigation pumps and sprinklers; and information technology. There is a fair amount of interplay of all three. Interestingly, Covid-19 has led to increased automation. There has been a more aggressive adoption of machines and technology after labour moved back home because of Covid-19 and lockdown. The last few quarters have seen the use of sensor technology and data analytics in farms. There are around 500 startups offering agritech — all of them have good tech ideas.Technologies have to translate into specific action and more income for farmers. If you say, I can bring micro local weather forecast, that by itself does not mean anything. It has to be combined with soil data, farm data, what was planted last season and combined with the data of the farmer, like investment capacity, labour availability, credit availability and so on, before being used to make a crop recommendation. Aggregators who are stitching all of this together will be essential in the ecosystem. E-Choupal 4.0, our current version, is one such aggregator. The second challenge is in developing a profitable business model. You make water-saving devices and precision farming tech, but water and power are free. You will be competing in a distorted market.Look at demand signals. What to grow? What varieties within crops? Then use technologies that help save money. Like those that check for pests and give weather forecast and soil reports. Third is marketplace of inputs — seeds, nutrients, crop protection, equipment for hire, etc. Last is access to markets with links to warehouses, derivative markets, F&O. Aggregators integrate all of these and offer a complete solution.Putting sensors and doing IoT are expensive for small farmers. It will work better in a hub-and-spoke model. Put sensors in one farm (the hub) and share (the data) with other farms so you have 150-200 farms around this hub. This can be provided to farmers as a service. We are only in the second season of these experiments. We can’t just say it worked in one season, so let us now expand it to a million acres. Because some mistake here could mean a huge impact on farmers. The experiments need to be properly validated.The government has data of soil, weather, etc. this can be put as a foundational digital stack. the government can build appropriate apis and offer this data to tech companies. once the government’s digital agri stack is built, it will help scale much better.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Economic Times,Can high-tech firms with actionable inputs eliminate ...,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/can-high-tech-firms-with-actionable-inputs-eliminate-uncertainties-in-agriculture/articleshow/77040874.cms
"The world is witnessing the fourth industrial revolution. Ever newer technologies are changing the way industries and businesses operate. In the midst of all this, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence are playing a key role in IR 4.0, which will create smart factories.

Sadly, India continues to be a laggard despite the push by the government to upgrade the country technologically through various digital programmes. Thus, it remains a matter of concern that connectivity exponentially falls off and is non-existent in rural and remote environments in India, precisely where the railways, farms, borders, powerlines, last-mile distribution centres and several other industrial operations need data.

Clearly, even as India is at the cusp of a complete digital transformation, it has a lot of catching up to do.

The government's programmes like Make in India, Digital India, and Startup India can be the vehicles for making India self-reliant in manufacturing as well as technology. At the same time, IR 4.0 technologies must also pass the test of Atmanirbharta set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi so that India does not become a dumping ground for obsolete technologies.

India's industries are still significantly manual, and machines, equipment, vehicles are largely unconnected because of which manufacturing often comes to a grinding halt. The factories need to be ""smart"" and machines and equipment IoT-ready. IoT and machine data can become a force multiplier to augment manual labour as automation can never be the answer in a populous nation like India.

The Make in India programme does not seem to be making India Atmanirbhar in the field IoT. Of the roughly 6,000 IoT patents filed in India between 2009 and 2019, more than 70 per cent were by multinational companies and a mere 7 per cent by India Inc and startups. More than 40 per cent of these patents were granted, of which multinationals accounted for 90 per cent.

India stood ninth on the list of FDI destinations in 2019, but these investments are not resulting in technology transfer and that includes defence offsets. Indians are creating the world's best technology globally but can this ""brain bank"" put an end to the dumping of outdated technology in India and help it become self-reliant in state-of-the-art technology.

The post-COVID-19 world will see an increased use of IoT on the shop floor and 5G technology will play a key role as the world minimises human interaction. A 5G network is essential to handle the projected exponential jump in data traffic, rising machine-to-machine connections, and an increase in the use of IoT devices.

The Paulraj Committee report on 5G recommends focusing on innovations in 5G applications as the 5G market in India takes off between 2019 and 2024. Experts warn that the delay in implementing this report will result in our trained manpower and huge market being exploited by the developed countries for building their 5G networks and IR 4.0.

The Prime Minister has talked about finding opportunity in the midst of crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic does provide India a chance to adopt 5G-IoT connectivity on a ubiquitous basis. The beneficiaries will include communities like fishermen who at times venture into waters of other nations due to rough seas or lose their lives as they are not connected in deep waters, farmers who lose crops to pests and soldiers in remote areas lacking access to critical data and connectivity.

India desperately needs a home-grown 5G-IoT digital highway for not only smart cities but smart villages too. The country should have a dedicated, digital highway for IoT and machine data, that is present everywhere and can be accessed from anywhere in the country at the lowest cost possible.

In order to implement the call for Atmanirbharta in letter and spirit we need to catch up rapidly through technological innovation. We are already late in rolling out 5G, but we have the opportunity to make up for lost time and also shrug off dependence on foreign technology and become self-reliant in 5G-IoT technology.

"2020 is the year when the photovoltaic industry moves from subsidy to parity, and also the year of great technological change. Since the beginning of the year, at least seven companies have released new PV modules, with power moving from 500W to 600W+.

The renewable industry in India is witnessing aggressive bidding, so the current trend and requirement for higher capacity PV modules and advanced technology string inverters to maximize plant generation and achieve a faster return on investments (ROI) is likely to increase at pace.

The new trend of technology adaptation tends to be either in the PV module or solar inverter segment, which helps PV projects achieve better results. They have many other advantages in terms of ease of design, project installation, and ease of operation and maintenance, which is also an added advantage with string inverter technologies.

The advancement of PV module technology further promotes the transformation of system design and inverter technology and realizes the reduction of LCOE (levelized cost of electricity). To promote the reduction of LCOE, PV power plant designs present three obvious new trends:

Trend 1 : High DC/AC ratio becoming the mainstream

: High DC/AC ratio becoming the mainstream Trend 2 : The adaptation of bi-facial modules usage exceeds 50% globally

: The adaptation of bi-facial modules usage exceeds 50% globally Trend 3: High watt peak power PV modules are widely used

It is exciting to see that new technologies promote the cost reduction and efficiency increase of the photovoltaic industry, but at the same time, there are numerous other challenges that project developers or IPP companies need to deal with. Taking into consideration all these requirements and understanding the market demand, Ginlong Technologies has designed and developed a new inverter for PV power plants: Solis-255K-EHV (“Solis 255K”) Ultra-High-Power Inverter.

Solis 255K will be launched in India on July 22, 2020, between 2:30-4:15 pm.

Leading PV experts- Shri Pranav Mehta, Chairman of National Solar Energy Federation of India, will share his insights on the challenges and opportunities of the Indian solar market and how ISA is supporting the global solar industry and the forecast for 2021. Mr. Parag Sharma, CEO of O2 Power Private Limited, will also be joining our new product launch as guest speaker.

For more details, please register at https://bit.ly/2Ba8uBm

1. 53 MPPTs design per MW supports 200% DC/AC ratio

A high DC/AC ratio can further improve the power curve to optimize a PV plant’s comprehensive income. Some inverters cannot achieve a high DC/AC ratio due to the limitation of inputs. Solis 255K, with rated power up to 255 kW, 12 MPPTs, and 24 string inputs and 53 MPPTs design per MW, meets the requirements of large-scale power plants and overall efficiency breaks through 99%. For the same 6.3 MW block design, Solis 255K inverter solution can reduce LCOE by more than 3.5%.

2. Supports 25A short-circuit current which allows compatibility with bifacial modules

In addition to the high DC/AC ratio, high-power, bifacial modules can also effectively reduce the LCOE, and are becoming popular and more widely used.

India introduced a solar power plant policy ten years ago, and now after a decade, India’s solar PV industry has grown rapidly with several solar parks and large rooftop projects.

The Government of India has set the target of 100 GW by 2022 and is also promoting the “Make in India” concept, due to which we have seen great increases in local manufacturing facilities for producing finished PV modules in India. A few companies have PV cell production facilities in India, and 70% of PV modules are imported from overseas to achieve the annual targets.

Compared with traditional PV modules, the short circuit current and nominal current of the new large silicon wafer modules can be improved by more than 35%. For bifacial modules, the power gain on the backside mainly comes from the current increase, by nearly 10%, with the highest close to 15Amp.

At present, the DC input capacity of mainstream string inverters in the market is about 12-13A, which can no longer meet the requirements of high-power bifacial modules. Aiming at the trend of high-power bifacial modules, Solis 255K upgrades, and improves the hardware and software. Solis 255K DC input current and short-circuit current of each string can reach up to 15A and 25A, which perfectly adapts to high-power bifacial modules.

3. Adoption of high-power bifacial modules, lower LCOE

Solis 255K is the highest power string inverter available today, which perfectly matches the high-power modules to help the system owner achieve a lower LCOE.

Compared with low-power modules, high-power modules can effectively reduce the cost of DC cables, inverter foundation, land, and labor. For 255kW inverter + high power modules, the cost savings on the AC side lead to a nearly 7% reduction in the LCOE.

4. Expandable Storage Interface

Solis 255K has an expandable storage interface to accommodate peak saving and provide electricity to support the load and reduce the overall power supply cost. Energy storage terminals are integrated, which can support up to 125kW charge and discharge power. This inverter facilitates the expansion of energy storage at a later stage, without changing any existing plant design. It can easily solve the requirement of whether the power plant needs energy storage now or in the future. Solis 255K has been designed to deal with current market demand, and it can easily adapt to become a storage inverter if storage is required in the future. The system can transform into an energy storage plant.

5. One-stop solution for developers

To match with the new trend of market technology changes, Solis 255K, with more professional technical methods adopted, provides a one-stop solution for all developers and IPP companies. Solis 255K has been designed to work with a high DC/AC ratio and with high current carrying capabilities, which are major concerns when using high-power bifacial modules.

Focus on quality and continuous innovation is the core strength of Ginlong Technologies. The design and manufacturing of Solis 255K will lead to a Green Energy Revolution.

"Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition

Xiaomi recently forayed into India’s laptop market with the Mi Notebook 14 and Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition. Xiaomi’s focus with the Mi Notebook has been to seemingly “simplify” the laptop market, all the while sticking to its inherent core philosophy to offer high-end specs and design at mainstream prices. We’ve reviewed the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition at length and found it to be quite a bang for your buck affair, though it isn’t without its flaws.

Having said that, laptops are a whole different ball game when it comes to after-sales. While Xiaomi went to great lengths to highlight the minimalist design, the top-notch hardware, and the attractive pricing of the Mi NoteBook at launch, it did not talk a lot about support and repair, two factors that are also taken into consideration when one’s buying a laptop. Even more so now, when more and more people are actually dependent on it for work, for leisure and whatnot. Questions around after-sales become even more relevant, in the case of the Mi Notebook, because Xiaomi is importing these laptops from China initially.

Financial Express Online spoke to Raghu Reddy, who is chief business officer at Xiaomi India, to try and get answers to all your burning questions about the Mi NoteBook, or at least, those that really matter (also, we decided to go rapid-fire on this one). Excerpts.

When did you start planning for a product like the Mi NoteBook?

Raghu: We started working on the category in early 2019 and after a rigorous market evaluation we have launched a much more balanced product portfolio offering best specs, minimalist design and an exceptional battery life.

Like the Mi 10, is the Mi Notebook also being imported from China? If yes, how is Xiaomi addressing the demand and supply scenarios?

Raghu: Considering that laptops were the most awaited category from our Mi Fans and consumers, we anticipated the demand and have adequate stocks to ensure that the consumer demand is met. Currently, we have imported these products and are on open sale starting 13th July.

Is there any possibility in the near future that Xiaomi laptops could be made in India?

Raghu: Once we achieve the scale and basis of the surge in demand, we will definitely explore manufacturing these at our factories in India.

What sort of warranty do the Mi Notebooks come with? How is Xiaomi handling after-sales?

Raghu: We are offering 1 year of warranty on all our Mi NoteBooks. One can avail Walk-in Service or Home Service for resolving any of their service queries. We have a strong 450+ ASC Network in India with 600 Trained Manpower covering over 19.4K pin codes to support after-sale services (for the Mi Notebooks).

How has the response been so far and is there any particular variant that’s seeing more demand in particular?

Raghu: From the date of launch, we have witnessed an overwhelming response from our consumers across all markets. Interestingly, we also saw 300,000 ‘notify me’ on Mi.com prior to the sale, coupled with the highest Google trends search for laptop category in the last five years. Looking at these trends, we are confident that the demand for this product range will continue to grow. Our bestselling model for now is the Mi NoteBook 14 Horizon edition- i7 variant.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Financial Express,"Mi NoteBook: Xiaomi reveals key after-sales strategy, make in India plans and customer response to debut laptops",https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/mi-notebook-xiaomi-reveals-key-after-sales-strategy-make-in-india-plans-and-customer-response-to-debut-laptops/2029765/
"‘Clean meat’ is created by growing meat outside of an animal from a small cell sample, eliminating the need for factory farming and slaughter.

Bollywood couple Genelia and Riteish Deshmukh have launched their latest business venture, Imagine Meats, focused on plant-based meat products.

The company will launch a variety of products, tailor-made for the Indian palate. The company has partnered with global ingredients manufacturer Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and Nutrition India, allowing it to access expertise in food science, flavours, and product development across Singapore, Berlin, and the United States. Using this gained expertise, Imagine Meats will develop food items relevant to the Indian non-vegetarian consumer, such as biryanis, kebabs and curries.

Imagine Meats has also worked in collaboration with the India arm of the Good Food Institute (GFI), a not-for-profit organisation which promotes plant-based alternatives to meat, dairy and eggs. ‘Clean meat’ is created by growing meat outside of an animal from a small cell sample, eliminating the need for factory farming and slaughter. Plant ingredients such as pea protein and coconut oil are also used while making clean meat, to replicate the taste and smell of animal meat. Such ‘clean meat’ products are better than soya nuggets and other ‘mock meat’ products, offering non-vegetarians a simple switch, which is better for the environment. ‘Clean meat’ products come without the risk of zoonotic diseases such as swine flu and avian flu.

“The result is 100% real meat, but without the antibiotic residues and bacterial contamination that come standard in conventional meat production,” says the GFI website. The growing use of clean meat is also expected to yield significant returns in terms of reducing land and water costs, as well as reducing the carbon footprint of societies at large.

“We want Imagine Meats to be the choice for anybody seeking the taste of meat, without the guilt of environmental and public health impacts – just as it will be for our own family,” said Genelia Deshmukh, founder of Imagine Meats

Rumours about the spread of Covid-19 through meat products spread rapidly in India during the lockdown, even as the meat and poultry industry was braving supply chain disruptions. The result was a slump in demand. Myth-busting campaigns have since explained that fears of the spread of Covid-19 through meat products are unwarranted. However, a change in attitude towards meat products among sections of the Indian middle class may be afoot. ‘Clean meat’ is also promoted as a personalised way of saving the planet from global warming, since animal slaughterhouses are heavy sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

India, of course, is a peculiar country, in that it has a large vegetarian population. Further, cultures within India, of Buddhism, Jainism and different strands of Hinduism also emphasise the virtues of vegetarianism. India has contributed more to vegetarianism than any other culture. The propagation of ‘clean meat’, if successful in incorporating the unique taste and texture of meat products, could see upper-class Indians consciously make a lifestyle change and adopt vegetarianism, while moving towards ‘clean meat’ to satiate their cravings for non-vegetarian food.

Varun Deshpande, managing director at the Good Food Institute India, said, “With our agricultural biodiversity and the opportunity to benefit our farmers and talented workforce, India can be a lynchpin of growth for the global sector. Covid-19 has underscored that we can no longer take our planet for granted.”

Meanwhile, Riteish and Genelia Deshmukh are not the first, but just the most recent Bollywood celebrities who have founded, or invested in startups. Actress Deepika Padukone has invested in several brands in the past, one of them being FMCG health-food brand Epigamia. Priyanka Chopra is one who’s invested in technology, with investments in alternative college education startup Holberton School and dating app Bumble, while Ayushmann Khurrana turned investor last year, with funding of an undisclosed amount in Gurugram-based male grooming startup The Man Company (TMC). There are also other celebrities such as Aishwarya Rai Bacchan, Arjun Kapoor, and Akshay Kumar who’ve donned the investor hat.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Inc42 Media,Bollywood Couple Riteish And Genelia Deshmukh Launch Plant-Based Meat Products Startup,https://inc42.com/buzz/bollywood-couple-riteish-and-genelia-deshmukh-launch-plant-based-meat-products-startup/
"Xiaomi is set to launch a range of products on July 15 (Source: Xiaomi Facebook) Xiaomi is set to launch a range of products on July 15 (Source: Xiaomi Facebook)

Xiaomi will soon unveil a range of products at its global Ecosystem Product launch 2020 event on July 15. The event will be live live-streamed across Xiaomi’s social media handles and Mi Community accounts. As per the photo posted by Xiaomi on Friday, the expected launches may include Mi Electric Scooter 1s, Mi Smart Band 5, much anticipated Mi TV stick, etc.

The Mi Band 5 has already been unveiled in China. Compared to Mi Band 4, the next version will have a 1.1 inch AMOLED display instead of 0.95 inch, more sports mode, and Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) Activity Index. The battery on the new band is expected to go on for 14 days on a single charge. The price of the band is expected to be Rs 2,500 for the NFC edition.

Let the countdown begin!

Can’t wait to share #MiSmartBand5 with you! 💖 See you in 4 days! pic.twitter.com/lPfHCA09F2 — Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) July 11, 2020

The Mi TV stick is another product that has been in the news. After launching the Mi TV box earlier this year, Mi is set to launch its TV stick to rival Amazon’s Fire TV stick with effective pricing. However, it is yet to be seen whether there will be two different models for Full HD and 4K streaming or just one. The 34-inch curved monitor is also expected to hit the global markets after its launch last year.

The Chinese company is unlikely to launch any major smartphone at the event. The Mi Scooter which was unveiled earlier this year in April is also going to be one of the highlights of the launch. The Mi Electric Scooter 1s sports a 500W DC brushless motor and 8.5-inch shock-absorbing tires. The scooter can achieve a top speed of 25 kmph. If launched in India, it is expected to be priced below Rs 25,000.

"E-commerce major Amazon’s global seller program has crossed $2 billion ( ₹30,000 crore) in cumulative e-commerce exports sales from India since its launch in 2015. The company said it has now set a target of $10 billion in exports from India by 2025.

“We will continue to empower Indian micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) at Amazon. We are committed to digitise 10 million MSMEs, create 1 million incremental jobs and drive $10 billion in E-commerce exports by 2025,"" said Amit Agarwal, senior vice-president & country head, Amazon India, at the launch of the third edition of Amazon Exports Digest.

Launched with just a few hundred sellers in May 2015, today this program has over 60,000 Indian exporters from different parts of the country taking ‘Made in India’ products global.

“This vision is more relevant than ever today, and we remain committed to boost exports from India and contribute towards the revival of Indian economy,"" added Agarwal.

MSME are the backbone of the nation and Amazon is digitally empowering these enterprises, helping to boost exports, create more jobs and helping to further the government’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. During the lockdown, Amazon has helped small enterprises to embrace technology to compete in global markets and help them sustain their families who depend on them.

Exports will play a crucial role in India’s economic growth and ecommerce marketplace provides an easy and rapidly scalable route for Indian MSMEs to generate higher foreign exchange for the country and in the process create employment opportunities.

According to Agarwal, the immediate priority areas to fuel e-commerce exports start from creating more awareness about e-commerce exports on ground; end-to-end digitization of processes for MSMEs to get started off as exporters and building effective yet low cost logistics solutions. Amazon has been working on all these focus areas through partnerships with various state governments and industry bodies, and initiatives like Start up India, Skill India, Digital India and Make in India with ecommerce exports.

Amazon witnessed a growth of 47% percent in the number of global sellers from India in 2019 with majority of them coming from cities like Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana. Cities like Jodhpur, Ludhiana, Varansi, Patna, Zirakhpur, Gunutr, Karnal and Erode were some of the emerging cities.

The key product categories exported include apparel, jewelry, tea, leather items, home decor, health & personal care.

The seller program is a perfect example of how homegrown businesses are going global, said Agarwal, adding that 60,000 plus MSMEs use Amazon to build a global footprint.

"Days after the Central government banned 59 Chinese apps, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday invited India’s tech community to participate in the ‘Digital India Atmanirbhar Bharat Innovate Challenge’.

Electronics and Information Technology (IT) Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, in a tweet, said the Prime Minister had launched the challenge to encourage Indian application developers and innovators.

Also read | Banning of 59 Chinese apps a ‘digital strike’, says Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad

Mr. Modi said that it would help create an “Atmanirbhar App Ecosystem”. “Who knows, I may also use some of these apps made by you,” he said in a post on LinkedIn. There is immense enthusiasm among the tech and start-up community today to create world class made-in-India apps, Mr. Modi said.

“To facilitate their ideas and products, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, along with the Atal Innovation Mission, are launching the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat App Innovation Challenge’,” the Prime Minister tweeted.

He said the challenge is for those who have a working product or for those who feel that they have the vision and expertise to create such products. “I urge all my friends in the tech community to participate,” he said.

India has a very vibrant tech and start-up ecosystem, which has done India proud nationally as well as globally, Mr. Modi said. The country’s youth have excelled at providing tech solutions across sectors, he added.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought about a big disruption, which is being tackled through the use of technology to aid our day-to-day lives,” the Prime Minister said.

Everyone is aware of the huge potential and the scale products can achieve if they can satisfy the demand, he said.

“Nowadays, we are seeing huge interest and enthusiasm among the start-up and tech ecosystem to innovate, develop and promote homegrown apps,” Mr. Modi said.

“Today, when the entire nation is working towards creating an Atmanirbhar Bharat, it is a good opportunity to give direction to their efforts, momentum to their hard-work and mentorship to their talent to evolve apps which can satisfy our market as well as compete with the world,” he said.

The challenge will run in two tracks, which are promotion of existing apps and the development of new apps, Mr. Modi explained.

For promotion of existing apps and platforms across the categories of e-learning, work-from-home, gaming, business, entertainment, office utilities and social networking, the government will provide mentoring, hand-holding and support.

“Track-01” will work in mission mode for identifying good quality apps for the leaderboard and will be completed in around a month. For incubating new apps and platforms, the “Track-02” initiative will work to help create new champions in India by providing support in ideation, incubation, prototyping, roll out and market access.

The outcome of this challenge will be to give better visibility and clarity to existing apps to achieve their goals, and to create tech products to find solutions to tech conundrums with the help of mentorship, tech support and guidance during the entire life-cycle, Mr. Modi said.

There is tremendous scope among these sectors for new apps which solve specific issues for India and the world, he said.

“Can we think of making traditional Indian games more popular via apps? Can we develop apps with targeted and smart access to the right age group for learning, gaming? Can we develop gaming apps for people in rehabilitation or getting counselling to help them in their journey? There are many such questions and technology alone can give answers in a creative manner,” Mr. Modi observed.

The challenge will be jointly hosted by the government and members of the tech community to make it more holistic, he said.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",The Hindu,PM Modi launches Atmanirbhar Bharat app challenge,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-launches-atmanirbhar-bharat-app-challenge/article31991458.ece

In the wake of multiple prolonged stand-offs with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh, India has conveyed to the US its renewed interest in the medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) armed Predator-B drone, which not only collects intelligence through surveillance and reconnaissance but also locates and destroys the target with missiles or laser-guided bombs.

While India is operating Israeli Heron unarmed drones in eastern Ladakh, the acquisition of an armed drone has acquired urgency with China not only using Wing Loong II armed drone but also in the process of supplying two systems (one system has two drones and a ground station) to Pakistan, ostensibly to protect the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the PLA Navy’s new base at Gwadar in the highly restive Balochistan province. Pakistan is also tying up with China to jointly produce 48 armed drones for use by the Pakistan Air Force. The GJ-2, military version of Wing Loong II, is said to be armed with 12 air-to-surface missiles and is currently being used in the Libyan civil war with limited success.

Although the US has offered to sell 30 Sea Guardian (unarmed naval variant, or UAV, of the Predator-B made by General Atomics) for over $4 billion, national security planners feel that due to the prohibitive cost of the UAV it would be better to have an all-in-one drone rather than separate ones for surveillance and targeting. Even though the Indian Navy is playing a lead role in negotiations with the US, the Indian Army is all in favour of the Predator-B. Also called the MQ-9 Reaper, the armed drone is battle-proven in the Iraq, Afghanistan and Syrian theatres with the capability of carrying four Hell-Fire missiles and two 500 pounds of laser-guided bombs.

While the US is willing to support India’s high-tech weapon requirements, it is wary of supplying the Predator-B drone for fear of leakage of the technology to Russia, New Delhi’s other hardware supplier. As it is, Washington is unhappy with India purchasing the S-400 missile system from Russia as it fears that the surface-to-air missile system may acquire signatures of US aerial platforms with India and convey them to Moscow. China has already acquired the S-400 system from Russia and currently deployed it across Arunachal Pradesh.

Even though Indian private sector companies based in Noida, on the outskirts of New Delhi, are now in the process of developing MALE drones for India, the capacity to acquire armed drones is some distance away. A number of experiments done in Ladakh have not been entirely successful with the drone being lost in high-velocity winds on the Tibetan plateau. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has plans to produce the MALE Rustom drone prototype by the end of this year.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Hindustan Times,India eyes acquisition of Predator-B drones from US,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eyes-acquisition-of-predator-drones-from-us/story-nVOOMnUWNh7KokbqE9uVYM.html

Updated: Jul 20, 2020 22:31 IST

Over the last two decades, India and China have become significant players in the digital ecospace with profiles that are different but convergent. India may be the world’s back office, but its presence in products — software and hardware — is relatively small. China, on the other hand, is big in both domains. On the basis of a back-of-the envelope calculation, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of their digital sectors over the past two decades appear roughly comparable: India’s digital sector has grown, on average, annually by around 35%, while China has recorded 50%+ growth. However, thanks to compounding of the difference in growth rates over 20 years, the final picture today is different. In 2019, China’s digital economy claimed to have crossed $5 trillion or over a third of the country’s total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In comparison, India’s current digital economy is estimated around $300 billion, or nearly 12% of the GDP.

China’s digital surge has not only reinvented the economy, but has also bolstered the nation’s growth rate. In 2019, for instance, its digital sector’s 15.5% growth was the biggest contributor to the national GDP growth of 6.1%. Globally, China’s digital economy is second only to the United States (US). Although the US still dominates with 18 companies in top-30 digital companies by market capitalisation (2019), China has seven companies in the list, including Alibaba ($402 billion), and Tencent ($398 billion).

Recently, however, there are signs that this lopsided China-India’s digital paradigm might be correcting. China’s domestic digital economy is getting saturated and its attempt to expand globally is encountering increased resistance. Last month, India banned 59 Chinese apps. The United Kingdom (UK) reversed its decision to allow Huawei to operate 5G telecom system, and, in this, joined a number of western countries uneasy about Chinese digital exports.

In contrast, India’s digital economy seems to be getting a tailwind. Over the past three months, Jio, the largest Indian telecom operator, has managed to get Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of over $20 billion from 13 global investors for its platforms. Google has announced its intention to invest $10 billion in India’s digital economy over the next five to seven years. Foxconn, which assembles Apple phones here, intends to ramp up mobile production by investing $1 billion in India, already the world’s second-largest mobile manufacturer.

Despite the enormous global economic challenges, the four Indian technology majors have had healthy growth in their turnover during Q2/2020. While these may be early hopeful signs of gains in India’s digital journey, we need to acknowledge its strategic importance.

At this juncture, we need to study the Chinese strategy over the last two decades to become a digital superpower. In the late 1990s, China realised the potential of these emerging technologies and leveraged them. Foreign digital companies recieved permissions to ply their wares in China’s huge market, but these were withdrawn soon in a seemingly systematic manner, and the entire domestic digital ecospace reserved for its home-grown entities. Thus, China is the only major economy where Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google (FAAMG) are either absent or remain marginal players. Their Chinese clones took full advantage of a near-monopoly to grow exponentially. Meanwhile, China invested heavily in digital hardware technologies from chip-making to telecom systems and acquired companies and start-ups abroad. Thousands of Chinese students and researchers went to western technical institutions to specialise in these domains.

While many of the pathways China took to become a digital superpower are relevant to us, replicating them has since become more difficult. Having lost China, FAAAM are determined not let go of India. They have also become more possessive about their technologies. On our side, too, the ecosystem has often rendered only tepid support to the home-grown digital companies. Indian IT companies grow despite the government. There is little point in rediscovering the wheel — we should try and leap-frog into the future.

To this end, a strategy leveraging our market size and competence to foster alliances between domestic and foreign digital companies will serve us best. The government can and should make this possible by creating a positive and forward-looking framework and adopt best global practices, particularly on Intellectual Property Rights, data security, taxation, land acquisition and employment.

A high-powered inter-ministerial entity could be created to supervise the digital sector and accelerate decision-making. Non-resident Indian (NRI) techno-entrepreneurs should be encouraged to lead this synergy, particularly in creating research and development capacity in emerging technologies, clubbed as the Industrial Revolution 4.0. We also need to develop human resources through better academia-industry interface, adopt employment-friendly syllabi and train our workforce. We also need to appreciate that unlike the brick and mortar economy, digital technologies are less beholden to lure of either geo-economics or size.

If the country’s digital economy soars, it will have comprehensive spin-offs for the Indian economy and society — from faster growth to higher employment generation to greater self-reliance in an area, both critical at present and strategic in the future. These are reasons enough for us to act — particularly in the current challenging economic times.

The Government of India has approved the purchase of 33 fighter aircraft to strengthen its air force amid the ongoing standoff with Chinese forces on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.

The acquisition, cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), will include 21 MIG-29 and 12 Su-30 MKI aircraft. the DAC also approved the modernisation of 59 existing MIG-29 aircraft.

The government will purchase the Su-30 MKI aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) at an estimated cost of Rs107.3bn ($1.43bn). Procurement of the MIG 29 fighters from Russia and the upgrade programme will cost around Rs74.18bn ($990m).

The proposal to acquire new fighter jets was forwarded to the Indian Ministry of Defence last month. The induction of the additional MIG-29 and Su-30 MKI aircraft will help the Indian Air Force (IAF) to increase its fighter squadrons.

India is also set to receive six fully loaded Rafale fighter aircraft by the end of this month.



Besides approving the purchase of new fighter aircraft, the DAC green lighted other acquisition proposals with a combined value of Rs389bn ($5.2bn).

The move includes acquisitions worth Rs311.3bn ($4.16bn) from Indian companies to support the local defence industry.

The procurement will include Pinaka ammunitions, BMP armament upgrades, and software defined radios for the Indian Army. The IAF and Indian Navy will receive Long Range Land Attack Cruise Missile Systems and Astra Missiles.

As planned, the systems will be manufactured in India with the participation of several MSMEs as prime tier vendors.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Airforce Technology,Government of India approves acquisition of 33 fighter jets,https://www.airforce-technology.com/news/india-acquisition-fighter-jets-from-russia/
"In a significant attempt to overhaul its functioning, TikTok has recently hired Los Angeles-based former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its Chief Executive Officer.

New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: Bytedance-owned TikTok, in order to highlight its purported independence from the Chinese establishment, is reportedly considering major changes in its overall functioning – corporate and otherwise – to dodge any halting or cancellation of Operations elsewhere in the world after being banned in India.

Amid the attempts to shift its base from Beijing to London, TikTok, in a significant attempt to overhaul its functioning, recently hired Los Angeles-based former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its Chief Executive Officer.

Why shifting base from Beijing to London has remained difficult for TikTok?

After initial reports that Bytedance was considering moving its headquarters from Beijing to London, British daily ‘The Times’ reported on Sunday that TikTok had to halt its talks with the UK. The instant-video sharing platform reportedly wanted to set up a 3,000-employee strong headquarter in London. The Times report said that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to freeze HUAWEI from its 5G network derailed the talks.

Will Bytedance sell TikTok to a non-Chinese entity?

The US media reports have suggested that given its Chinese origins, at least three officials from Trump administration, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have hinted at a Tiktok ban this month, much on lines of what India did last month. A White House source was quoted as saying by Reuters that it expects TikTok to separate itself from its Chinese owner and operate as a US company.

However, Bytedance is also said to be considering selling TikTok to a non-Chinese company to avert a potential US ban. Earlier this year, a Beijing-based gay dating app Grindr had to sell its 98 per cent stake to a US-based company San Vicente Acquisition Partners after being declared a ""national security risk"".

"The first data centre building with a built-up area of 230,000 sqf in the data centre park is expected to be ready by the last quarter of 2021.

Yotta Infrastructure, a Hiranandani Group subsidiary and a managed data centre service provider developing hyperscale data centre parks in India, has signed an MoU with the Government of Tamil Nadu to set up a data centre Park in Chennai.

The company said in an announcement that this help to generate 2000-2500 direct and indirect jobs in the State of Tamil Nadu.

The Hiranandani Group and its group companies, along with Yotta, will invest up to Rs 4000 crores in this proposed project over eight to 10 years.

The Government of Tamil Nadu will provide facilitation and support in the form of infrastructural support, regulatory approvals, permissions and/or registration facilitation subject to applicable laws.

Darshan Hiranandani, Group CEO – Hiranandani Group said, “We’ve chosen Chennai to set up our data centre park since it’s a global hub for major technology companies as well as has the strategic advantage of being a major international fibre landing station.

“Chennai is of immense geographic significance since it will help us have a physical presence in South India. This move is in line with our vision of partnering in nation-building efforts by creating the technological infrastructure that will power Digital India.

“We’re delighted to receive such a warm welcome from the Tamil Nadu Government to set up the data centre park.”

The proposed data centre park will be built on a 13-acre campus at Hiranandani Parks on the Singaperumal – Oragadam highway in India.

It will host a total of four data centre buildings with a capacity of 20000 racks, backup generator sets and featuring a total power load of approximately 150-240 MW.

Like its Navi Mumbai facility, this data centre park will also be carrier-neutral with the presence of major telcos and own fibre network. The campus will also house a 220/110 KV electrical substation and a CNG power plant.

“Data centres are crucial to cater to the increasing demand for cloud services and digital content consumption across the country, and we welcome the Hiranandani Group and Yotta Infrastructure to set up their data centre park in Chennai.

“We will be extending our full support towards this project and once completed, this data centre park will provide important cloud-based services to companies not only in the state but across India, serving as an important milestone in strengthening our digital infrastructure.”

The facility will offer 25 MW IT power and have a capacity for 5000 racks.

“With our first Uptime Institute certified Tier IV data centre building – Yotta NM1 – we have proved that world-class infrastructure facility at an affordable cost can be a reality,” said Sunil Gupta, Managing Partner & CEO – Yotta Infrastructure.

“While Yotta NM1 will serve the western region, our Chennai data centre park will offer the same Tier IV infrastructure facilities to the southern region, thus filling in the void of quality colocation services in the region.

“Yotta being a complete managed hybrid IT infrastructure provider, will also provide customers various customized options to suit their requirements with enterprise managed services.”

MUMBAI: Hitachi has completed the merger of its joint venture power business unit with ABB Power Grids, known as Power India, a statement said on Wednesday.

The merger follows the completion of the global merger of the energy business vertical of the Swiss major with the Japanese conglomerate.

The merged entity is known as Hitachi ABB Power Grids globally.

While Hitachi owns 80.1 per cent stake in the new joint venture which has a combined business of USD 10 billion, ABB holds the balance, the companies said in a joint statement.

Following this, Hitachi will directly be responsible for the management and operation of Power India or ABB Power Products and Systems India which comprises part of Hitachi ABB Power Grids, and is listed on the BSE and NSE (as Power India).

The merger also involves moving the assets of Asea Brown Boveri's or ABB's shareholding in ABB Power Products & Systems India (APPSIL).

ABB Power Products & Systems India was incorporated in February 2019 and was listed in March 2020 and an open offer is underway to buy back its publicly held shares.

The open offer was launched on March 30, 2020.

Power India is traded on the exchanges and will continue to be public company post-open offer.Globally the new behemoth is known as Hitachi ABB Power Grids with USD 10 billion in annual sales, and the new entity began commercial operations, the companies said.

The companies said the merger ensures that the complementary portfolios and technology strengths will enable continuity, enhance customer value and bring growth opportunities.

""In accordance with the agreement signed on December 17, 2018, Hitachi and ABB today completed all required procedures for the formation of Hitachi ABB Power Grids in the 80.1:19.99 joint venture respectively, creating a new global power leader, the statement said, adding the new entity is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.

Assuming satisfaction of those conditions, the Company expects the merger to close on or before the end of 2020.

Upon completion of the transaction, Majesco expects to continue to operate under the leadership of CEO Adam Elster and the existing Majesco Leadership Team.

“ Our decision was made with the best interests of our stockholders and we believe that the transaction will also benefit our 2,400+ employees and our more than 200 customers,” said Elster. “ We are extremely excited to partner with Thoma Bravo, a firm with an established track record of working with companies transitioning to the cloud. This transaction delivers significant cash value to our stockholders. Moreover, the added flexibility we will have as a private company, combined with the benefit of Thoma Bravo’s knowledge and domain expertise, can allow us to more effectively focus on our long-term investment and growth objectives, to the benefit of our employees, customers and partners. We are in alignment with Thoma Bravo on our strategic vision to help global insurers transition to the cloud.”

Matt LoSardo, a Vice President at Thoma Bravo added, “ We’ve followed the impressive Majesco journey for many years.

"With the merger process over, state-owned is looking to complete the technology integration of and with itself by the end of the current fiscal, the head of the country's second largest lender said.

The merger of and with Punjab National Bank became effective from April 1.

""The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic has delayed the process of integration by a couple of months. We had planned for May. Technology integration has many dimensions, for example integration of ATM switches. We hope to complete that process by September,"" Managing Director S S Mallikarjuna Rao told PTI in an interview.

The integration of the core banking solution platform would take slightly longer time as the merged entity had an older version of this platform, he said.

""We will complete Finacle (CBS) integration and ... all surrounding technologies latest by March 2021... one bank will be migrated by December and shifting of second will be over before March,"" he said.

With the merger, the bank now has about 11,000 branches, more than 13,000 ATMs, 100,000 employees and a business mix of over Rs 18 trillion. Total domestic business of at the end of March 2020 stood Rs 11.81 trillion.

However balance-sheet wise, Rao said that and booked losses in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020.

The losses were mainly due to provision against bad loans, he said, without giving numbers as they have not been made public.

On the outlook for the current fiscal, Rao said PNB will earn moderate profit in the current fiscal, aided by treasury income and core banking activities.

For the fourth quarter ended March, the bank posted a net loss of Rs 697.20 crore. However, after a gap of two years, the Nirav Modi fraud hit bank posted profit of Rs 363.34 crore in 2019-20.

He also said that the bank has scaled down its loan growth target to 6 per cent for the current fiscal due to the Covid-19 crisis.

However, he said, the bank has a treasury advantage due to reduction in interest rates resulting in Rs 1,000 crore gain in the first quarter of 2020-21.

""We are confident that quarter-on-quarter, we can book moderate profits. We do not like to have higher profit because we want to strengthen the balance-sheet during 2020-21.

""We are very confident that we will be creating a better base for the bank not only for booking moderate profit in 2020-21 but also creating a robust situation for 2021-22,"" he said.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Business Standard,"Complete tech integration with OBC, United Bank of India this fiscal: PNB",https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/complete-tech-integration-with-obc-united-bank-of-india-this-fiscal-pnb-120062301525_1.html

"The edtech space in the past few months has seen such developments recently

After witnessing a downward trend in M&A activities during the year 2019, the year 2020 would bring about significant, if not better, activity

Much like in other jurisdictions, in India too, despite the increasing economic turbulence and geopolitical instability of past years, corporate India remained keen, resilient and remarkably steadfast with occasional peaks and minor bouts of inactivity.

After witnessing a downward trend in M&A activities during the year 2019, both in volume and deal numbers, there was, and continued to be, an expectation that the year 2020 would bring about significant, if not better, activity. The previous financial year 2019-20 closed with an M&A value of $82 billion which is a disheartening decline from the record high of $128 billion in FY 2018-19.

Capturing A Half-Year Update Of M&A In 2020

The current financial year began with significantly ruptured normalcy, with the deterioration of the capital markets and with the engines of economic growth ebbing towards a grinding halt resulting from the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic all over the world.

The Government enforced restrictions on carrying on with business in the ordinary course. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations has re-estimated the best and worst-case scenarios for 2020 global output growth on April 01, 2020, at 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively. The above figures are likely to exacerbate if restrictions on movements and economic activities extend beyond the second quarter of 2020.

Before the outbreak of Covid-19, world output was expected to expand at a modest pace of 2.5% in 2020, as reported in the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2020.

According to Grant Thornton India’s April 2020 deal tracker, aggregate M&A and PE deal volumes reported a 37% and 22% fall respectively compared to deal volumes in April 2019 and March 2020. However, its May 2020 deal tracker reported, (excluding of four PE transactions in Jio), a 16% and 25% growth compared with May 2019 and April 2020, respectively.

Revisiting Business Outlook

Irrespective of the sector, all business enterprises are having to revisit their business outlook and are attempting to address concerns regarding the valuation of their enterprise and dealing with the liquidity crunch. Diversified enterprises will see, in addition to the above, an increasing pressure to restructure portfolios and deleverage their balance sheets.

PE Trends Observed

While the broad spectrum of the tech industry, healthcare sector, pharmaceutical sector, insurance, consumer products retail, ecommerce industries could see some significant uptick in M&A activity, if not already during the nationwide lockdown and thereafter, certain other sectors such as the construction industry, automobiles, hospitality, entertainment and aviation sectors, directly impacted by Covid-19 induced economic restraints, could faceless or delayed activity.

It is no secret that some large companies which have excess cash will be on the lookout for reasonably priced deals to possibly expand and/or diversify. A key trend which is likely to pick up is private equity fund houses which are flush with liquidity, joining hands with business enterprises to carry out acquisitions in the days ahead.

While the transactions may not commence/conclude immediately, one could definitely see a marked increase once the moratorium is lifted, and many companies will discover and announce inability/diminished ability to make post-moratorium payments to financial institutions in connection with their financial assistance from lenders. Such a situation would possibly lead to another round of M&A activity.

Regulatory Changes And Its Impact

The regulatory framework has been enhanced with many recent announcements, facilitating increased economic activity including investment and acquisition opportunities which could augur well for many sectors/industries including manufacturing in India.

The Scheme for Promotion of manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) could see many electronic manufacturing establishments being put into place by asset/business purchases or by joint ventures. With this, every business enterprise would also evaluate their group structures and make an assessment of the restructuring requirements through mergers, demergers, asset/business transfer.

Many business enterprises may also consider consolidation to ensure business continuity. Such a consolidation could majorly be horizontal or a vertical combination which could unlock potential and facilitate exit with higher returns while achieving better economies of scale.

The presence of a suitable regulatory framework, particularly the February 2020 amendment to the Companies Act, 2013 regarding dealing with dissenting minority shareholders is a relief. These recently notified provisions are likely to pave way for many consolidations in corporate India considering the current market conditions.

Expected Changes In M&A Activities In 2020

There are various new considerations for parties participating in either ongoing or proposed M&A transactions. Such consideration ranges from concerns regarding valuations, liquidity crunch at the enterprise level and consequent reallocation of surplus funds etc. to the very idea of proceeding with the transaction itself.

Many business groups with varied interests may introspect on the various business segments that they are engaged in and identify one or more segments amongst them which have not been profitable or sustainable and either shut down or divest the same.

On the other hand, there may be many enterprises with an established presence in certain verticals or geographies which could look at potentially entering into new territories and business segments.

The edtech space in the past few months has seen such developments recently. A ‘decacorn’ that BYJU’s is, which itself has a cadre of marquee investors, has been steadily gearing up for acquiring (i) WhiteHat Jr, a smaller rival of BYJU’s; and (ii) Doubtnut, a two-year-old education learning app which will provide BYJU’s with access to customers from smaller cities and towns across India, whereas its existing market base is primarily in urban Indian cities.

Aakash Educational Services Limited, the national leader in the test preparation sector, which was already in the process of ramping up its entry into edtech segment prior to the onset of Covid-19, recently set up a new subsidiary for accelerating the consolidation of its digital learning segments.

Similar acquisitions can be noted in the ‘essentials’ online grocery delivery startup Bigbasket with the acquisition of milk delivery platform – DailyNinja.

Another trend of acquisition – ‘acqui-hiring’ or acquiring startups primarily for their talent, for business with requirements of emerging skills, particularly in the current market set-up is likely to pick up. Titan recently acqui-hired an IoT Startup — Hug Innovations, for its wearable IoT segment, a market which Titan is keenly pursuing. Similarly, in the ed-tech space, upGrad has acqui-hired CohortPlus, an online community for product managers and data science enthusiasts, with a view to reach a much larger and relevant audience.

The need for expansion and consolidation is not necessarily constrained by geographical boundaries. Recently, BrowserStack, cloud web and mobile testing platform based in Mumbai, acquired Percy, a San Francisco Bay Area-based company, which will be adding newer capabilities to BrowserStack’s product suites, which largely targets the developer market. Such acquisitions help in saving time and go to market faster. Significant traction could also be expected from Indian companies vying for an overseas product, technology and customer acquisition.

Valuations of many global business enterprises are also down to a historical low leading to a scenario where Indian companies like Infosys are exploring acquisitions outside India focused on cloud, data and business platforms as the current situation could offer more of such opportunities.

To improve financial and solvency position of state-owned general insurance companies, the Union Cabinet Wednesday approved fund infusion of Rs 12,450 crore in Oriental Insurance Company Limited, National Insurance Company Limited and United India Insurance Company Limited. The government has given up plans of merging the three companies that was earlier announced in the Union Budget. This funding support comprises Rs 2,500 crore equity that was infused in 2019-20, another Rs 3,475 crore will be released immediately, while the balance Rs 6475 crore will be infused later.

“Further, the process of merger has been ceased so far in view of the current scenario and instead, the focus shall be on their profitable growth,” the government said in a statement. To enable fund infusion in these companies, the government has also enhanced their authorised share capital. The capital infusion will enable the three general insurers to improve their financial and solvency position, absorb changes and enhance the capacity to raise resources and improved risk management.

The boards of the three insurance companies had in January approved the merger process, setting the stage for the formation of a big insurance entity. Though former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced their merger in Budget 2018-19, there was hardly any momentum in its implementation. The three companies have different technology and IT platforms, and platform migration and integration would have been an immediate challenge.

The Cabinet also gave gave nod for a three-month extension to the ongoing EPF (employees’ provident fund) contribution support for companies having up to 100 workers and 90 per cent of them earning up to Rs 15,000 per month. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in May announced the extension of the benefit under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana till August.

Under the PMGKY package, the government will make payment of 12 per cent of employer and 12 per cent employee contribution into the EPF accounts for the eligible companies for the wage months of June, July and August. The benefit was provided earlier for salary months of March, April and May.

“The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi today has given its approval for extending the contribution both 12 per cent employees’ share and 12 per cent employers’ share under Employees Provident Fund, totalling 24 per cent for another three months from June to August, 2020, as part of the package announced by the government under PMGKY/Aatmanirbhar Bharat in the light of COVID-19, a pandemic,” an official statement said.

The total expenditure under the scheme is estimated to be Rs 4,860 crore covering over 72 lakh employees in 3.67 lakh establishments.

"With COVID-19 continuing to extend its reach globally, economic growth has plunged, and the competition for foreign investment is intensifying, spurred on by national campaigns to shift supply chains and the urgent necessity to reverse recessionary trends. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is falling and the immediate picture for many countries is not looking pretty. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development just released its latest World Investment Report and projected that FDI to developing Asian economies could drop by as much as 45%.

One sector that is expected to buck this trend is digital services. Now more than ever, it is clear that digital services have become critical to every 21st century economy. Quite literally, digital services are filling gaps when national or global emergencies interrupt more traditional modes of commerce. Digital services enable access to and delivery of a wide array of products across multiple sectors, from healthcare to retail distribution to financial services.

Even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, investments in digital services continue to flow at record levels globally, outpacing investment in nearly every other sector. India is an ideal destination for increased FDI flows in the digital services sector and offers undeniable potential for innovative homegrown start-ups not least because of its huge and increasingly digitised population. However, Indian government policies will be key determinants in how quickly and at what level the Indian economy attracts new investment, fosters Indian innovation, and expands its exporting prowess.

Three pending measures

Currently, there are three pending reform measures under consideration that are likely to affect India’s growth trajectory in digital services for years to come — the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB), the e-commerce policy, and the Information Technology Act Amendments. Approaches in these regulatory reform efforts seem to emphasise a focus on protecting the domestic market for domestic companies and prioritising government access to data. It may be difficult to reconcile these approaches with India’s strong interest in promoting data privacy, protecting its democratic institutions, and encouraging FDI and India’s position as a global leader in information technology. Understandably, there is uncertainty about when these changes will be completed and implemented.

Also, the course of the India-U.S. trade relationship is uncertain, as signs of progress are continually interrupted by setbacks in the form of new restrictions.

The bilateral relationship is an important factor in realising the potential for greater trade and investment in digital services. The strategic relationship has been growing, reflecting how their historic ties have evolved over time. Where the relationship has lagged is with respect to trade. India and the U.S. are yet to conclude negotiation on a bilateral trade agreement that could address some digital services issues, and the U.S. just initiated a “Section 301” review of whether digital services taxes in 10 countries constitute “unfair” trade measures, including India’s equalisation levy.

As India resumes its efforts to put into place a new architecture for digital services and as it pursues opportunities to attract new investment, the government and stakeholders might consider the full range of implications for the long-term. How might new policies affect India’s ability to attract foreign investment? How might these policies promote innovation through increased competition and create an environment that is friendly towards homegrown start-ups? Ultimately, what policies can best advance the objective of becoming a $5 trillion economy?

India will be host of the G20 nations in 2022, and it appears clear that post-COVID-19 international cooperation and approaches to good governance in the digital sphere will be top-priority initiatives. The steps India takes now could well establish itself as a true global leader.

"Note: This is the second in a two-part series that reviews the geopolitical and constitutional repercussions emerging from the Indian government’s decision to restrict access to 59 Chinese apps from India.

This broader analysis seeks to evaluate the suitability of the move given the strategic limitations within which these measures were operationalised. The first part, which situates the move in the context of the global trade debate, can be read here.

§

The decision to block access to Chinese apps has significant consequences since a large part of the Indian population accesses those services regularly. TikTok has more than 100 million active users in India. Combined with more affordable internet recently, Tik Tok has brought marginalised people online in a way no other app has been able to. Trans, lower caste, independent artists from rural areas are creating and broadcasting content on TikTok in a way that was previously the monopoly of groups with greater social capital.

Not only is the short-from video app convenient to use, but it is also more accessible for it has given people who don’t lead instagrammable lives or even speak English the confidence to share their work and showcase their skills.

Reports demonstrate how TikTok gave a voice to entrepreneurs and small business owners in rural India. That the ban has come into being during the pandemic is particularly unfortunate given the sense of community that the platform brings people during isolation.

Another group that is severely impacted by the app ban are the Tibetan refugees in Delhi who use We Chat to connect with their families and friends back in Tibet. They also rely on this app to get access to news and information. They cannot use other global social media applications like Facebook or Whatsapp since it is banned in Tibet. Further, WeChat is easy to use, and voice messages do not require literacy in Tibetan, enabling refugees who do not read Tibetan to participate in groups.

Similarly, in the past decade or so, many Indian students have enrolled in Chinese universities. They too depend on apps like WeChat to communicate with their colleagues and administrations.

Any account of freedom of expression that does not consider how this ban will affect already marginalised communities is disingenuous at best. Since apps that provide a platform for expression and allow for the dissemination of information are protected by Art.19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution, a constitutional challenge to the ban is likely.

Recently, the Kerala High Court in Faheema Shirin v. State of Kerala recognised that interfering with someone’s access to the internet violates inter alia their fundamental right to privacy.

Subsequently, the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India observed that an indefinite suspension of the internet could amount to an abuse of power. However, it fell short of reaffirming the position laid down by the Kerala High Court. However, since the decision in Faheema Shirin has not been overruled subsequently, it holds enormous persuasive significance and should correctly be assumed to be the correct position in law. Assuming therefore that there does exist freedom of access to the internet under Article 19, it becomes important to evaluate the effect the geoblock on Chinese Apps has on this right.

In order for the freedom of speech and expression to be meaningful, the right must be inclusive and available to everyone; not just those with the requisite social capital to access applications with relatively complex and inaccessible user interfaces. This is particularly true because of low levels of digital literacy in India. The freedom to express in this context should be understood to include the manner in or platform on which people wish to express themselves. Further, even if one is to assume that the freedom to engage in trade or business is not available to Chinese app developers (presumably non-citizens), they continue to exercise the right against under article 14 (as explained below).

Disproportionate Impact: Is the Geoblock Unfair and Arbitrary?

In Justice Puttaswamy (Retd.) I v Union of India as well as the decision concerning Modern Dental College the Supreme Court has reaffirmed that rights cannot be viewed as distinct compartments. They must be viewed as a network of interconnected freedoms that complement each other. The most obvious right to get implicated by a geoblock is the fundamental right to access the internet.

Admittedly, the basis of imposing such a restriction has to be one of the numerated conditions mentioned under Article 19(2) (i.e. public order, national security, etc). At the same time, however, due to the interconnected nature of constitutional freedoms, it would also have to be fair, just and reasonable under Article 14. This means that the manner in which the geoblock is imposed should not be arbitrary.

This right under Article 14 is available to both citizens and non-citizens. The Press Information Bureau notification, therefore, potentially raises two distinct claims based on the right to equality under Article 14. The first, by Chinese tech giants who are already raising concerns of dissimilar treatment with apps developed in other jurisdictions which could potentially also be similarly inconsistent with inter alia privacy concerns (in fact, the Calcutta High Court has recently held that a foreign entity can file a writ petition in an Indian Court in the context of Article 226 of the Constitution).

The second, by Indian users who feel that the decision to ban Tik Tok restricts their access to the internet and the ability to express themselves in a manner that is unreasonable.

In order for a geoblock to be fair, just and reasonable, it would have to be consistent with Article 14 which requires that all persons are treated equally before the law. Article 14, however, does allow dissimilar treatment between two different classes provided that the classification made between them is reasonable.

A classification between two groups (e.g. Chinese apps on the one hand and American or all other apps on the other) is reasonable if two conditions are satisfied. First, there exists some intelligible differentia, or distinguishing feature between the two groups. Second, the dissimilar treatment has a rational connection with the object that it seeks to achieve.

The notification treats Chinese investors (i.e. app developers) differently from all other app developers who may also be making similar applications and have been reported to raise similar concerns of (cybersecurity, misinformation, etc.) in the past. Chinese apps are hardly alone in the mass personal data collection that go beyond what an average consumer would think they are handing over to the app.

American- or European-incorporated companies (e.g. Facebook, Uber and Amazon) have come under similar scrutiny in their home countries and by international agencies for their data mining policies. In fact, India’s own Reliance Jio markets itself saying “data is the new oil”.

Further, as already explained above, the differential treatment of Chinese apps results in arbitrary and unjust denial of access to the internet realistically.

However, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India & Ors., the Indian Supreme Court (para 81) admitted that Section 69A read with the Information Technology (Procedures and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 permit the Indian Government to impose narrowly tailored restrictions on access to content. The Court further acknowledged that in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India & Ors., the Supreme Court had acknowledged the constitutionality of section 69A. The Court (in para 111) recognised that the rules are not unconstitutional.

Also read: Where Does India’s Ban on Chinese Apps Fit Into the Global Trade Debate?

To put it simply, the restriction must be on access to specific platforms on the internet and not access to the internet as a whole. Granularly determined restrictions to access could potentially satisfy this condition, subject to other provisions in the Constitution being met (discussed below).

While granularly tailored geoblocks could be constitutionally permissible and proportionate, whether the decision to block access to these 59 Chinese apps specifically without any clear and cogent classification invites a closer constitutional inquiry.

Is this use of technology for diplomatic gains excessive?

It is settled law that fundamental rights can only be limited by state actions that are proportionate to the intended object. The test to determine what state actions are proportionate was laid down by the Supreme Court in Modern Dental College v. the State of MP. In addition to being backed by law, the following conditions to be satisfied:

Pursues a legitimate interest, Is suitable (i.e. there has to be a rational connection between the means adopted and the object sought to be achieved), Is necessary (the means adopted must not be excessive, i.e. it should be the least intrusive measure in the given set of circumstances and Is proportionate (i.e. the balance between the interest in restricting the right must override the need to safeguard the right).

Each of the aforementioned conditions needs to be satisfied, for the geoblock to be regarded as proportionate:

Backed by law and legitimate:

The notification is backed by law, i.e. section 69A of the IT Act, which empowers the Government to impose geo-blocks that target specific websites.

Section 69A contains both substantive and procedural safeguards against unreasonable restrictions to access to the internet (albeit imperfect ones). However, as indicated in this report reviewing the legality of Aarogya Setu, courts have seldom been concerned with the absence of specifically enumerated statutory safeguards in restricting fundamental rights. As long as the notification itself adequately has the force of law (i.e. it is contemplated within the existing statutory framework) it would be hard to argue that the Notification banning Chinese apps was not contemplated within the scope of section 69A. The strategic interest cited in the Notification which is sought to be achieved also could be regarded as legitimate, particularly in the context of the possibility of external aggression.

Suitability:

At present, there is insufficient information on precisely how using Chinese apps in India raises national security concerns to an extent warranting a complete ban of the apps. However, research suggests that Chinese laws require app services to necessarily share user data upon request. Further, a recent study indicated that most Chinese apps (including Helo and Shareit) collect relatively excessive information such as access to microphones, cameras and precise cell-site location information which is not necessary to render a particular service.

While this measure could objectively indicate that Chinese apps need to increase underlying privacy safeguards, a study comparing the operability of Chinese apps with apps originating outside China on play store or apple store is yet to be conducted. In the absence of such a study, a stand-alone review of Chinese Apps may suffer from the absence of a comparative to know how it fares in relative terms. Through a careful comparison measuring the extent to which Chinese apps relatively raise greater concerns which form the basis of the Notification would help establish the suitability of directing a ban specifically against China. This would also help corroborate a cogent and rational connection with national security concerns. Singling out all Chinese apps may require some unique basis in order to be considered a ‘suitable’ restriction.

Further, vulnerabilities that could stem from access to the apps could be stemming from a rather systemically rooted problem: India continues to remain bereft of a robust data protection framework almost three years since Justice Puttaswamy I (Retd.) v. Union of India was decided.

Necessity:

In order to establish that the geoblock is necessary, the Government would have to demonstrate that its purported objective could not have been achieved through less restrictive means.

In order to do this, first, it would have to establish that the geoblock necessarily had to apply to all the apps listed in the Appendix. This is because the list seems to be category-agnostic, i.e. it includes not only social networking applications (WeChat) but even other apps that facilitate phone syncing, those that control or enhance phone operability (e.g. Clean Master), along with web browsers (U.C browser). Each of these apps have a different functionality. Since the extent to which each of the Apps listed in the appendix pose a threat may also be different, the decision to include all of them in the list just because of country of origin may be considered excessive.

Second, it would have to explain why the scope of the restriction was not narrow enough to only require inter alia government, judicial or army officers to refrain from using the App. Since these officials typically are engaged in handling official secrets, the restriction could have been narrowly tailored in this manner. This has in fact realistically been done in the United States where military personnel were advised against using the TikTok by the Defense Department.

These are only indicative suggestions as to how the government could have potentially adopted a less restrictive route in safeguarding the purported interests sought to be achieved through this move. Even though the burden to prove that this was the least restrictive measure is of course on the Government, these facts indicate the extent to which the move could be considered excessive.

Balancing stage

In order to know whether the diplomatic and security interests sought to be achieved through the geoblock outweigh civil liberties affected by the move, a careful examination of the procedural and the substantive safeguards relied upon to curtail the right is crucial. The adequacy of existing safeguards help in understanding whether the geoblock in the manner in which it has been imposed excessively curtails civil liberties when compared to the interest sought to be achieved.

The general procedural safeguard against blocking access to the internet that such orders must be backed by a certified copy of a court order. Judicial scrutiny ensures that there are some checks and balances against executive indiscretion. However, there is an exception to this rule.

Rule 9 of the Blocking Rules 2009, empowers the Government to impose a geoblock (such as in this case) without providing a prior opportunity to be heard to an online intermediary (i.e. an entity providing an online service, e.g. a Chinese app). Since TikTok and other intermediaries (e.g. internet service providers) have been offered a post-decisional hearing, it seems as if the basis of the geoblock was rule 9. This means that the Government must have assumed the existence of an ‘emergency’ to impose the geoblock.

The meaning of emergency in the context of an order under section 69A of the IT Act, however, is not clear. Shreya Singhal also did not go ahead and define what an emergency means in the context of blocking access to the internet.

In Anuradha Bhasin, the Court did not objectively define what geopolitical conditions constitute an ‘emergency’. It is not clear whether the meaning of an emergency in the context of temporary suspension of internet access would be the same as defined earlier by the Supreme Court while constitutionalising wire-tapping.

In People’s Union of Civil Liberties v. Union of India, in the context of a challenge to the constitutionality of section 5 of the Telegraph Act, 1885 (i.e. the provision enabling wire-tapping), the SC clarified that the threshold of public emergency is even higher than the grounds stated in Article 19(2) of the Constitution. The Court defined public emergency to mean “the prevailing of a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting the people at large calling for immediate action”.

The nature of concern that the public emergency raises has to draw its colours from the restrictions enumerated under Article 19(2) (e.g. national security). Since the threshold that triggers a public emergency is even higher than the conditions enumerated under Article 19(2) (the conditions are discussed below), the decision to bypass a pre-decisional hearing before imposing the geoblock may have been unwarranted.

Substantive safeguards

The PIB notification refers to the following conditions (all but one) mentioned under Article 19(2) of the Constitution as the basis to impose a geoblock, namely, sovereignty and integrity of the state, defence and public order.

In Shreya Singhal, the SC referred to an earlier decision (in Ram Manohar Lohia) which drew three concentric circles to explain when each of the three conditions is triggered. This was done to explain the graded difference in gravity of each condition under Article 19(2) forming basis to impose restrictions on freedom of expression.

The inner-most circle represents security of the state (being the most serious condition among the three), the immediate outer circle being public order and the outermost being law and order. This means that stray instances of criminality affecting law and order are not adequate to constitute a situation that affects public order.

At present, the precise scale at which cyber threats could result in a public order breakdown is not clear. There is a potential concern about users amplifying disinformation on platforms such as TikTok which is no doubt corrosive to the democratic process. However, this concern persists on virtually every internet platform (e.g WhatsApp) which deals with misinformation and it is unclear how a ban will solve anything. News reports have also highlighted how TikTok perpetuates existing hierarchies and promotes hate mongering.

While these are valid concerns, stray instances of cyber crime using these apps could at best be considered to compromise law and order, a threshold not adequate to legitimately restrict the fundamental right to access the internet.

A restriction on access to the internet also has to be fair, just and reasonable and not arbitrary at the very least. Consequently, a restriction which is arbitrary also affects the right to equality under Article 14 of internet users in India, since they are entitled to fair, just and reasonable restrictions to access to the internet.

The diplomatic interests sought to be achieved through the geo-block could be legitimate. However, the geo-block specifically against Chinese Apps may not be a suitable means to achieve these interests. Rolf Dobielli in ‘The Art of Thinking Clearly’ highlights how crucial it is for us to be able to draw meaningful distinctions between varying degrees of threats. A content-agnostic measure sets a worrying trend of executive indiscretion, hurting access to the internet, generation of value and in turn international trade.

Since the geoblock disproportionately impacts the quality of expression of millions of users, it is difficult to regard it as minimally intrusive, enabling overboard restrictions on civil liberties.

"India should set up a data regulator and require companies to disclose how they collect and store data devoid of personal details or which has been anonymised, a panel tasked to draw up such regulations has said in a draft report seen by Reuters.

As India moves to tighten policies on its citizens’ data held and processed by companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, it set up the panel last year to make recommendations on the regulation of “non-personal data”.

This is a term for data viewed as a critical resource by companies that analyse it to build their businesses and describes information that is independent of personal details such as names, or anonymised to protect people’s identity.

“There is a need to create a regulator or authority for data business, which provides centralized regulation for all non-personal data exchanges,” the government-appointed panel said in the report.

Such a regulator would be armed with legal powers to request data, supervise data sharing requests and settle disputes, it added.

Panel chief Kris Gopalakrishnan, a founder of Indian technology giant Infosys, declined to comment on the 30-page undated draft, which has not previously been reported.

The panel is in the final stages of deliberation on the report before it is submitted to India’s information technology ministry, a person familiar with the discussions said.

A company collecting data beyond a yet unspecified threshold should register as a “data business” in India, the report said, with government bodies also subject to the need to disclose what information they collect and store, and how they use it.

The panel consulted companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Uber, as well as some international experts, in drawing up the report, it said.

Regulation of non-personal data is just one of several areas for which India looks to hammer out policy, which will affect tech giants in a regulatory trend gathering momentum worldwide as nations step up efforts to control data.

India has drafted an e-commerce policy that also calls for a new regulator, while a separate privacy bill under review has upset tech companies.

Some data held by the private sector could be drawn on if needed to make policy and back wider social objectives such as healthcare, the panel said.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",CNBCTV18,Panel proposes new regulator for non-personal data; here're details,https://www.cnbctv18.com/information-technology/panel-proposes-new-regulator-for-non-personal-data-herere-details-6303351.htm

San Francisco, July 10 (IANS) Microsoft has introduced a new platform security technology to prevent data corruption techniques being adopted by cyber criminals to target system security policy and tamper with data structures on Windows 10 devices.Called Kernel Data Protection (KDP), the technology prevents data corruption attacks by protecting parts of the Windows kernel and drivers through virtualization-based security (VBS).According to the company, KDP is a set of APIs (application programming interfaces) that provide the ability to mark some kernel memory as read-only, preventing attackers from ever modifying protected memory.""For example, we've seen attackers use signed but vulnerable drivers to attack policy data structures and install a malicious, unsigned driver. KDP mitigates such attacks by ensuring that policy data structures cannot be tampered with,"" the tech giant said in a statement this week.The concept of protecting kernel memory as read-only has valuable applications for the Windows kernel, inbox components, security products, and even third-party drivers like anti-cheat and digital rights management (DRM) software.KDP uses technologies that are supported by default on Secured-core PCs, which implement a specific set of device requirements that apply the security best practices of isolation and minimal trust to the technologies that underpin the Windows operating system.""It enhances the security provided by the features that make up Secured-core PCs by adding another layer of protection for sensitive system configuration data,"" said Microsoft.--IANSna/",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Business Insider India,Microsoft introduces new security technology to prevent data corruption,https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/microsoft-introduces-new-security-technology-to-prevent-data-corruption/articleshow/76894487.cms

"Policybazaar is gearing up for a $500 million initial public offering (IPO) as the online insurance platform drives a wave of rising demand for coverage from India’s rising middle class.

Policybazaar is looking at September of 2021 for the IPO, Co-Founder Yashish Dahiya told Bloomberg, a move that would value the Indian startup at a hefty $3.5 billion.

In a first step, Policybazaar is pushing ahead with plans to raise another $250 million from investors and is also gearing up to pick two or three lead underwriters for the IPO, with the field of candidates including a number of big Wall Street banks, Bloomberg reported, citing Dahiya, who is CEO of Policybazaar’s corporate parent, ETech Aces Marketing and Consulting.

Softbank Group’s Vision Fund is a top investor in Policybazaar, having recently agreed to pump an additional $130 million into the online insurance platform’s parent company. Other investors include Tencent Holdings and Tiger Capital Management.

The company plans to list only in Mumbai, as current Indian regulations don’t permit dual listings by financial service companies or by companies or in other “sensitive sectors.”

Policybazaar’s drive to expand and go public comes at an opportune time, with the Indian government pushing to extend health and other insurance policies beyond the tiny slice of the population that currently has coverage.

As of 2017, just 3.69 percent of India’s population have insurance coverage, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation. Of the 57 insurance companies in the country, 24 sell life insurance policies and the remaining 33 provide health and other coverage.

However, the industry has grown significantly in recent years in India, with life insurance carriers doing particularly well.

Life insurance companies have seen the premiums they collect from Indian policy holders to more than double over the past eight years, rising from just under $40 billion in 2012 to more than $94 billion in 2020, according to IBEF.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",pymnts.com,India's InsurTech Policybazaar Eyes IPO,https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2020/indias-insurtech-policybazaar-eyes-ipo/
"As data has been defined to include “insights collected from data,” such access to data by the government would infringe upon intellectual property rights

In India, with a myriad of developmental issues, the scope datasets could have in driving policy interventions is large

Personal data includes all data about or relating to a person who is directly or indirectly identifiable by such data. All data collected by a body, that cannot be classified as someone’s personal data can be termed as non-personal data. In common parlance, non-personal data includes data sets aggregated and collected by various mobile applications and websites and devices on the internet, arising from the digital trail that individuals (data principals) leave in the wake of their internet usage.

This could include data generated from individuals about their behavioral patterns, preferences on social media and intermediaries that have been collected and further anonymised. Moreover, it could also include large quantities of data on climate trends generated by a weather app, the traffic patterns generated by a taxi app which, did or did not originate from an individual, or cannot be identified to an individual.

In contrast with personal data, which can be traced back to an individual, the critical difference between personal and non-personal data arises from the fact that it challenges the notion of individual control over data as individuals are unlikely to be aware of what their personal data can reveal when aggregated with a multiverse of other data points.

As a collective resource, aggregated data must be leveraged for better governance. It can guide policymakers to innovative solutions to modern-day problems, keeping data as evidence.

Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019

Use Of Non-Personal Data In Governance

The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 gives powers to the government (clause 91(1)) to frame policy with the aid of non-personal data for growth, security and integrity of the digital economy, and for the prevention of misuse of data. For this purpose, the government will also have the power to direct any data fiduciary/data processor to provide non-personal data to ‘enable better targeting of delivery of services or formulation of evidence-based policies.’

In India, with a myriad of developmental issues, the scope datasets could have in driving policy interventions is large. For example, industries such as health tech, fintech and telecom have started to rely on datasets to innovate and provide new-age solutions.

As per this clause, the government can access data from both data fiduciaries and data processors, which includes non-personal data or anonymised data. This undermines the existing business practices wherein the data processor is contractually bound by the data fiduciary and cannot share data (personal or non-personal) or any insights thereof, as they belong to the client of the data processor on whose behalf the data processing entity is conducting data processing activities as per instructions and contract.

This will have a huge impact on business confidence of clients and foreign nationals, of data processing companies in India as they would be apprehensive of the government’s access to data.

Such a provision is likely to discourage innovation and investments in India, as the government is asking for non-personal data as well as anonymised personal data. There are also concerns that business-sensitive information, including trade secrets, can be sought under the Bill’s ambit.

As data has been defined to include “insights collected from data,” such access to data by the government would infringe upon the intellectual property rights of companies and other businesses. This clause is likely to bypass the control of the data fiduciary and obligations of data processor under its contract with data fiduciary.

De-Anonymisation of Personal Data by Govt

Under clause 91(2) of the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, the government in consultation with the Data Protection Authority has the power to direct any data fiduciary to provide for anonymised personal data for the purpose of evidence-based policymaking. The definition of anonymisation as given in the bill provides for an irreversible process but given the nature of cryptography, the anonymisation, as well as de-anonymisation techniques of data, is simultaneously growing. Though the aim is to achieve absolute irreversibility of anonymised data, it cannot be disregarded that the technology for de-anonymization is also growing.

Additionally, the scope of this bill should be limited to the protection of personal data and individual privacy. Venturing into the territory of non-personal data should not be the aim of this bill. Therefore, this provision should be deleted fand until the report on non-personal data by the expert committee is published, the government should refrain from making any policy decisions with regard to non-personal data.

Challenges & Opportunities

It is important that any regulation that is dealing with non-personal data, must allow for its free flow and provide access to data sets for communal benefits and in building a digital economy. It must aid innovation and the establishment of a larger ecosystem surrounding data. Allowing for data sharing framework, and free flow of data allows users of data processing services to use the data gathered in different markets to improve their productivity and competitiveness.

Users can, therefore, take full advantage of the economies of scale provided by the large market, improving their global competitiveness and increasing the interconnectivity of the data economy.

The aim of the new law must be to reassure that the rights of citizens to the protection of their personal data are always respected, including when their data are mixed with other types of data, or that their data are properly anonymised.

The law must balance the interest of the businesses and individual privacy and security on two sides. While it is welcome to see the government increasingly rely on aggregated data to leverage its potential in driving effective policy changes, there needs to be a stronger, detailed framework that looks at the possibility of excesses of power, and its effect on the market.

Moreover, the placement of provisions relating to non-personal data in a Personal Data Protection bill is a mismatch. The Data Protection Authority has a mandate to regulate matters relating to privacy and personal data of the users. Against this backdrop, it remains unclear how the provision is to be operationalised, with no empowered regulator in place to keep a check.

"It’s 2020, and it’s no secret that the world has entered the digital era and that the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has accelerated this process. The impact of COVID-19 has been a wake-up call for pharmaceutical and healthcare leaders, which are now embracing new and innovative technologies to operate in the post-COVID era 1 and to ensure that they are prepared for similar unforeseen crises in the future. From using data to better understand patient preferences—and delivering a personalized experience based on that data—to securely delivering medical information, mastering digital technologies can help pharmaceutical organizations shape the next generation of healthcare.

According to a report by Royal Philips for the 15-country Future Health Index (FHI) 2019, India is a frontrunner in the adoption of digital health technology with 76% of healthcare professionals in the country already using digital health records (DHRs) in their practices. 2 This shows that India’s healthcare industry is moving toward the digitization of their operations in a bid to improve the patient experience.

Top Digital Technologies

Investments in digital technologies, such as mobile, analytics and cloud, have varied by healthcare sector over the years. The new opportunity lies in preparing for the next wave of disruption. Among the top emerging disruptors are DARQ technologies, which have the potential to improve workforce productivity and patient experiences while also reducing the cost of care.

So, what are DARQ technologies? DARQ stands for distributed ledger technology (D), artificial intelligence (A), extended reality (R) and quantum computing (Q). Just as social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies have created new or enhanced business models, such as mobile e-commerce, DARQ is a set of technologies that, when combined, could create the next wave of consumer experiences and business models in healthcare. 3

Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) - DLT enables large-scale collaboration and transactions among strangers – without middlemen or third parties – as well as self-executing smart contracts. This includes technology like blockchain, which will be crucial for secure patient identity and data management. For example, pharmacists could rely on a single, secure database for more efficient access to patient records. Moreover, by aggregating anonymized patient data, a pharmaceutical company could get a market-wide view of a drug’s efficacy in real-world use.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) - AI automates business functions, captures unprecedented amounts of data and enables the benefits of analytics to be more easily accessed. The FHI 2019 report also indicates India meets the 15-country average when it comes to the usage of AI within healthcare at 46%. It can be used to help streamline analytical processes and increase productivity by automating traditionally manual tasks or learning user preferences to reduce the number of clicks it takes to perform a task. This enables more accurate medical analysis and reduces the chances for human error. AI-powered smartphone apps and digital health tools allow patients to self-serve by providing a personalized experience to augment diagnoses and receive custom care options.

Extended Reality - This creates new, immersive environments and provides on-demand information. Use cases for clinical, research and educational purposes is gaining popularity, but the potential is endless. Organizations may choose to equip pharmaceutical reps with augmented reality applications, create virtual prototypes or simulate interactions between molecules in the lab.

Quantum Computing - This can solve complex data sets that may help with discovering new drugs, materials and transforming cyber security.

Apart from DARQ technologies, other forms of emerging solutions include:

o Temperature Monitoring and Sensing - Temperature monitoring and sensing indicators provide vital data to ensure the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products during storage, transit and shipping. Patients are also provided an added layer of security, knowing that their medications have not been compromised during delivery.

o Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) - Patient care requires flawless fulfillment. Global tracking with mobile barcodes and RFID provides operational, actionable data on the location and condition of vaccines and other perishable drugs. RFID embedded tags locate tagged objects in real time. RFID solutions offer pharmacists visibility into prescription stock without the need for manual data entry and accurate unit-dose level data for all products. This transparency helps with the decommissioning of expired or damaged inventory and reverse decommissioning of uncollected medication.

The Latest in mHealth

The scope for leveraging mHealth as an alternate delivery channel in India is substantial. According to data gathered from Google Trends, a tool which analyzes the relative interest in a particular search term, India ranks among the top five countries for search terms like ‘mobile health’, ‘health apps’, ‘medical apps’ and ‘mHealth’. This confirms that the Indian population is interested in mHealth 4 .

The digitalization initiatives undertaken by the Indian government, including the digital biometric identification program (Aadhaar), have created a favorable ecosystem for the digital healthcare market and benefit various e-Gov initiatives like the National Health Portal, e-Hospital, and Integrated Health Information Program (IHIP), which further fueled market growth. Moreover, the steady inflow of foreign direct investment has stabilized the digital healthcare market by addressing the concerns of stakeholders. 5

A large segment of the population (65%) resides in rural areas, where the low-income group lacks access to quality healthcare. Hence, the greatest opportunities lie in providing digital healthcare to patients in remote areas or where healthcare access is limited. With mHealth technology, it is now possible to connect patients to healthcare professionals regardless of distance.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",BW Businessworld,Digital Health Solutions And mHealth To Revolutionize The Indian Healthcare Industry,http://www.businessworld.in/article/Digital-Health-Solutions-And-mHealth-To-Revolutionize-The-Indian-Healthcare-Industry/20-07-2020-299270

This is a great time to invest in India and the country is welcoming investments in the tech sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told IBM CEO Arvind Krishna on Monday.

In a virtual interaction with Krishna, the prime minister noted that while the world is witnessing a slowdown, FDI inflow in India is increasing.

Modi said the country is moving forward with the vision of a self-sufficient India so that a globally competent and disruption resilient local supply chain can be developed, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.

Talking about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on business culture, the prime minister said ‘work from home’ is being adopted in a big way and the government is constantly working towards providing infrastructure, connectivity and regulatory environment to ensure that this technological shift is smooth.

Modi also discussed the technologies associated and challenges involved in the recent decision of IBM to make 75 per cent of its employees to work from home, the statement said.

The IBM CEO briefed the prime minister about his company’s huge investment plans in India and expressed confidence in the vision of an ‘Aatma nirbhar Bharat’ (a self-reliant India), the statement said.

“The prime minister highlighted that this is a great time to invest in India. He said the country is welcoming and supporting investments taking place in the tech sector. He noted that while the world is witnessing slowdown, FDI inflow in India is increasing,” the statement said.

In the course of interaction, Modi explored the possibilities of creating India-specific artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools in the healthcare sector and development of better models for disease prediction and analysis.

He underlined that the country is moving towards developing an integrated, tech and data-driven healthcare system which is affordable and hassle-free for the people.

Modi noted that IBM can play an important role in taking forward the healthcare vision.

Krishna appreciated the prime minister’s vision for Ayushman Bharat (the all-India healthcare scheme) and talked about using technology for early identification of diseases.

Modi appreciated the role played by IBM, in association with CBSE, towards launching of AI curriculum in 200 schools in India.

He said the government is working towards introducing students to concepts such as AI and machine learning at an early stage, to further the tech temperament in the country.

Krishna said teaching about technology and data should be in the category of basic skills like algebra, which needs to be taught with passion, and should be introduced early.

Other areas of discussion included the issues of data security, cyber attacks, concerns around privacy and health benefits of yoga.

Modi also congratulated Krishna on becoming the global head of IBM earlier this year. He mentioned the strong connection of IBM with India and its huge presence in the country, with over one lakh people working across 20 cities in the company.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Hindustan Times,Great time to invest in India: PM Modi tells IBM CEO Arvind Krishna,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/great-time-to-invest-in-india-pm-modi-tells-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna/story-eSPwIxdYqhSLodD6LLKBmL.html

A year back, hospital administrators at a trust run hospital in Mumbai found their systems locked, with an encrypted message by the cyber attackers demanding ransom in Bitcoins to unlock it. The hospital lost 15 days’ data related to bill payments and patient history. In an interview with Viveka Roychowdhury, Shomiron Dasgupta, CEO, DNIF rues the fact that given this scenario, hospitals in India spend around 5 per cent or even less of their budget on IT security while banks in India spend around 15-20 per cent of their budget on IT security. As the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a sudden shift to digital healthcare services, he warns that these are prone to cyberattacks since the EHRs are shared through an insecure network with multiple users. The sector is also vulnerable to medjacking of medical devices such as MRI, ventilators

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an increased dependence on the migration of healthcare delivery systems to the digital realm, be it telemedicine for doctor-patient consultations to electronic health records, etc. As infection levels are projected to rise and fall over the next year, there is an explosion of health data. Are hospitals and healthcare systems in India capable of supporting this increased load?

The Indian healthcare sector is blooming to become the sixth-largest market globally as predicted by Indian Pharmaceutical Congress. Maintenance of Electronic Health Records (EHR) is a new adoption in the Indian healthcare industry, which consists of patients’ past medical history, recent tests and diagnosis, progress, and medications. They are combined in a single database to reduce the incidence of medical errors and redundant tests, thus reducing delays in treatment, also helping patients to make well-informed decisions and streamlining clinical workflow. The medical sector in India is technologically advancing and so are the risks. In the black market, stolen medical records hold a higher value than credit card numbers. The medical data sold consists of sensitive information like date of birth, policy numbers, payment, and billing details. The consequences of theft lead to the creation of fake identities and launch other illicit activities. Unlike hospitals, banks can immediately block accounts if any suspicious activity is detected. The medical identity theft detection in the healthcare industry is not quick, giving hackers adequate time to cause more damage. Banks in India spend 15-20 per cent of their budget on IT security, while a hospital may only spend 5 per cent or even lesser, which poses a challenge to cybersecurity becoming a focal point in the healthcare sector.

In June 2019 a trust run hospital in Mumbai was affected by a cyber-attack where the hospital administrators found their systems locked, with an encrypted message by the attackers demanding ransom in Bitcoins to unlock it. The hospital had lost 15 days’ data related to bill payments and patient history. Digitisation in the Indian healthcare sector is taking baby steps but lack of awareness about cyberattacks and safeguarding medical data are still at a nascent stage.

Which means that hospitals in India do not as yet have the systems in place to protect patient confidentiality and themselves from data theft?

As said that the concern of cybersecurity in healthcare is at a nascent stage in India. We need a robust framework to prevent medical data breaches. In Indian healthcare organisations, there are two kinds of patient information: patient identification information and health information. This information is handled by different departments and information systems. The patients do not have ownership of their medical information and third-party administrators are the ones who control the health data locally. The technologies offered by third- party administrators to healthcare organisations share data are making it susceptible to various attacks by malware, cyberattacks, and ultimately, leading to severe data breaches.

To help threats in the healthcare industry, DNIF, our Big data platform allows scalable architecture for integrating large volumes of data generated from emails, endpoint logs, and network logs. It can also integrate with all types of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) applications that allow more insights into low-level transactional details. With healthcare-specific visualisation, our dashboards can offer a rich set of use cases to detect cyber threats. DNIF Next-Gen SIEM works beyond the signature-based detection of a conventional SIEM solution to hunt hidden threats in the healthcare IT infrastructure. DNIF reports can be customised basis the organisational needs and give critical input for managerial decisions.

The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team has reportedly warned about the possibility of a major phishing attack, where cybercriminals plan to gather the email ids of 2 million Indian citizens with an email having the subject line ‘COVID Free Testing’ which impersonates an established medical institution. What are the other lures being used by hackers to dupe doctors, patients, and healthcare administration staff?

Healthcare professionals are at the forefront of battling the Coronavirus and are at a high risk of getting infected. With more emphasis on minimising physical interactions, several hospitals and start-ups are providing health consultations online. A study says that the healthcare IT market is expected to reach USD 390.7 billion market shares by 2024, with a 15.8 per cent forecast CAGR growth. The lockdown since March saw a 500 per cent rise in online doctor consultations. However, every innovation comes with hidden risks, digital healthcare services are prone to cyberattacks since the EHRs are shared through an insecure network with multiple users, that are susceptible to be compromised by the malware. This scooping of information results in committing fraud, identity theft, or credit card scams. They can also alter the data in the dashboard by changing the patient’s appointment time, changing medical history, or changing the drug doses prescribed which can be life-threatening. The hackers might launch attacks on newly introduced, less secure e-medical portals and might impersonate a trusted healthcare provider to entice the helpless consumers to click on malicious emails.

Masks, sanitisers, and PPE kits are the need of the hour for hospitals and they require these in bulk. However, cybercriminals are capitalising on this opportunity by luring the hospitals to click on emails informing about fake discount offers.

Explain the concept of ‘medjacking’. What are the red flags of such incidents?

Medjacking is a medical device hijack. This hijack can allow attackers to create backdoors in hospital networks and exploit the main healthcare systems by breaking into the unpatched and outdated medical devices. Hackers are aware of the fact that medical devices have no such threat detection mechanism thus giving them no visibility or control. Medical devices such as MRI, ventilators and are directly connected to computers and once they get a hold of the devices, it might lead to them getting access to all the vital medical records. The consequences of hacking devices can lead to the display of faulty results giving incorrect diagnosis and even jeopardising patients’ life, also maligning the reputation of the equipment manufacturer.

How can patients, healthcare practitioners, and institutions detect and protect themselves from such threats?

As technology advances, the sophistication of attacks becomes intense and sooner or later your organisation is going to be cyber-attacked, here are some ways to protect you and your organisation.

Practising good cyber hygiene: Lack of employee diligence makes systems vulnerable to hacking. It is important to make employees selective and cognizant about malicious emails with sensational email headlines and unexpected email attachments or emails from an unknown or untrusted source with subject line-‘Breaking news’.

Building firewalls of protection: Organisations should create a balance among prevention, detection, and containment, and proactively build firewalls of protection as well as implement detective controls and response mechanisms.

Virtual Private Network: A Virtual Private Network is a tool that provides a pathway that makes your communication and other online activities secured. A VPN configuration ensures that the privacy of data and interactions exchanged over the web are secured.

What role can the Government play in such a scenario, besides implementing a similar strategy for public healthcare institutions?

The adoption of tech advancements and digitisation in the healthcare industry is taking place gradually in India. The Government of India has established the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre under the amendment of the provisions of section 70A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 which conducts cybersecurity exercises to keep a check of the cybersecurity status and preparedness of the sectors. The sectors it considers critical are power and energy, banking, financial services and insurance, telecom, transport, strategic and public enterprises. With the emergence of telemedicine portals and healthcare going online, the government should now consider the healthcare sector prone to cyberattacks and should conduct regular workshops to make healthcare institutions cognizant of cyber hygiene. The government should appoint Chief Information Security Officers who can identify the security requirements that come up with each technological innovation.

"Now that Covid-19 has made its ugly presence felt in every sphere, including business and economy, a huge portion of upcoming businesses shall have to rely on small industries and other forms of entrepreneurship. This, contrary to opinions of scaling up and infrastructure, also stands true for healthcare markets.

Healthcare, medical, and health-tech entrepreneurship has already imparted tremendous value and volume to healthcare industries globally. Many such startups and their products or services have been licensed and marketed by pharma and med-tech behemoths. Appropriate nurturing and valuation of such startups and scale-ups is being recognized—albeit gradually—in the Indian healthcare scenario. However, with Covid-19 (and more generally with such pandemics and crises), the economic aftermath can change abruptly, and sometimes for the better; and this can be conducive to a fresh slew of ideation/conception of healthcare and health-tech startups.

Healthcare startups typically consist of medical technology (hardware devices and diagnostics), software-based medical applications (AI/ML, app-based solutions, AR/VR and radio imaging solutions); healthcare delivery solutions (digital platforms and their deployment); telemedicine operations (the entire remote-based infrastructure with strategic nodes and internodes); and supply chain logistics (part of healthcare value chains).

There have been a few reports about apprehensions and challenges that will be faced by such startups in a post-Covid world. Here are some of the atypical and obscure challenges that will present itself to healthcare startups and med-tech crunchers—maybe a while later in their entrepreneurial journey.

The seven-point challenge and how to mitigate them

Revamped regulatory models/frameworks: To counteract the financial losses, extensive regulatory strategies to overhaul and remedy the healthcare market, including the medical technology market, are poised to be devised. These will be backed by government and other industry-regulatory apex bodies and will be on a global scale. The startup founders, platforms and entire ecosystem along with other industry stakeholders need to be aware of the strategies and incentives (and roadblocks) and judiciously and proactively devise innovative implementation strategies—both at the technology level and the business level to gain the momentum.

Infrastructure support required: Huge healthcare/med-tech breakthroughs like AI/ML, AR/VR coupled with novel applications has brought a paradigm shift in addressing patient-centric and precision medicine approaches to diagnostics and theranostics. Effective adoption and penetration of such state-of-the-art technologies concomitantly require an equally sophisticated and cost-effective business platforms like remote operations, telemedicine, digital interfaces, computational power, supply-chain logistics, etc. Specifically, healthcare technologies and business models that are based on remote operations—a strategic and essential lesson in current times—require a high level of seamless integration between the respective technologies, back-hand infrastructure support, and highly-skilled workforce.

Redundancy and ‘me too’ products: In order to ride the forthcoming wave of entrepreneurship opportunities (and constraints of employment economics), there will be a flurry of products and devices that will flood the healthcare/medical market. Many of such technologies are not suitably IP-protected nor are aware of Freedom to Operate regulations. Lack of proper innovation strategies will be a deterrent to monetise the product (or a delivery platform) over a period of time. Additionally, there will be steep competition to navigate and reach out to the appropriate customer segment. As a result, many of these ventures will face the “valley of death” even before the pre-launching phase (prototype development phase/scale-up phase).

Judicious investment: Concomitant with the above point, the same entrepreneurs and startups will face tough investment deals and options from angel investors, venture capitalists, series funders, and other non-dilutive sources of funding, especially at the initial stage. Even if they have crossed the initial path, they will face a steeper adoption curve for their technology as well as have difficult negotiations with the bigger corporates while licensing deals/trajectories.

New business model and delivery model: With breakthrough healthcare technology innovation comes the need for brilliant delivery models and newer business models to maximise the value of the output and accessibility of such an innovation. The appropriately-selected choices of delivery platforms (and business models) to target the appropriately-segmented customer profile can harness the innovative brilliance of the technology—by both clinicians (medical workforce) and patients alike. This itself needs a sustainable and robust inter-connection of different healthcare stakeholders from clinicians (and medical workforce) to the patient on the one hand, and healthcare startup strategists/platforms to startup founders/entrepreneurs themselves.

Resource utilisation, including personnel training: Effective deployment of healthcare technology and delivery needs to be supported by proper, sustainable, and cost-effective resource utilisation, including medical personnel and patients training for remote operations and digital deliveries. Some of these platforms are in the nascent stage for the Indian healthcare system and proper uptake and directed training are very critical for sustainable leverage—clinical and commercial—of such technologies.

Strategic and reciprocal partnerships with bigger entities: Newer and innovative technologies, applications, and platforms have to be (and have historically often been) incorporated into bigger device platforms or deployment systems or have been independently licensed by bigger med-tech/biopharma corporates. This will become even more crucial (and hence a deciding factor in the sustainability of the startup) especially in the post-crisis period for mainly two reasons: the breadth and continually-innovative capabilities of such startups and the effective deployment and accessibility acumen (including investments and business development strategies) of bigger entities.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Fortune India,The hidden challenges for health-tech startups,https://www.fortuneindia.com/opinion/the-hidden-challenges-for-health-tech-startups/104659
"As the world grapples with a new way of life and the COVID-19 crisis peaks, its impact on everyone’s mental and physical health is indescribable.





The pandemic is not only creating a major impact on the global economy, it is also helping to accelerate the development and commercialisation of several emerging technologies that previously received lukewarm consumer response. This is predominantly accurate for innovations that reduce human-to-human contact, automate processes, and increase productivity amid social distancing.









With Artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) rapidly gaining ground in varying forms and degrees, the use of these innovation has begun to appear in a wide spectrum of technologies - from the phones we use to communicate to the supply chains that bring goods to market. It is modifying the way we interact, consume information, and obtain goods and services.





Healthcare is no exception to this new disruption. In the medical industry, the impact of AI, IoT, and other technologies through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), is transforming care delivery.





Data suggests that AI simplifies the lives of patients, doctors, and hospital administrators by performing tasks that are typically done by humans, but in less time and at a fraction of the cost.





It allows patients to track their ultrasounds, thermometers, glucose monitors, electrocardiograms, etc., by being connected through technologies like AI and IoT. These are reinventing and reinvigorating modern healthcare through machines that can predict, comprehend, learn, and act.





A major trend in medicine, when it comes to AI, is using deep learning in medical diagnosis to detect cancer. A recent study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute shows that the AI system has achieved a breast cancer detection accuracy comparable to an average breast radiologist.





With the ability of AI networks to train radiologists, there are chances that their performance will be significantly improved in the nearest future.





Another promising implementation is the use of AI and the Internet of Medical Things in consumer health applications, which allows them to gather healthcare data and process the information and offer adjustments to the current lifestyle of a patient.





Its major purpose is to improve the hospital room experience and simplify the process of preparing patients to continue their healing at home. Also, virtual nurses reduce patient anxiety, improve safety, keep people entertained, and increase patient satisfaction with medical services.





When it comes to medical diagnosis, doctors have seen that applying AI & IoT to medical diagnosis provides numerous benefits to the healthcare industry. AI and IoT based software can tell whether a patient has a certain disease even before evident symptoms appear.





But what AI is extensively helping doctors in is the ease that it is providing in classifying diseases. With deep learning technologies that analyse images and recognise patterns, it is creating a huge potential in generating algorithms that are helping healthcare officials in diagnosing diseases faster.





Moreover, research suggests that AI-driven software can be programmed to accurately spot signs of a certain disease in medical images such as MRIs, X-rays, and CT scans. Existing similar solutions already use AI for cancer diagnosis by processing photos of skin lesions.





By using such tools, doctors are able to diagnose patients more accurately and prescribe the most suitable treatment for them at an earlier stage, resulting in increasing the chances of cancer prevention.





Henceforth, we can say that from patient and self-service to chatbots, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for diagnosis, and image data analysis to identify candidate molecules in drug discovery, AI, IoT and other technologies are already at work.





They are swiftly helping in increasing convenience and efficiency, reducing costs and errors, and generally making it easier for more patients to receive the healthcare they need. While each technology can contribute significant value alone, the larger potential lies in the synergies generated by using them together across the entire patient journey, from diagnoses to treatment, to ongoing health maintenance.

It can easily be said that AI and IoT solutions can lead to better care outcomes and improve the productivity and efficiency of care delivery. They can also improve the day-to-day life of healthcare practitioners, letting them spend more time looking after patients, and in doing so, raise staff morale and improve retention.





It can even offer life-saving treatments to markets faster. With the increased use of AI and IoT in healthcare, it will certainly influence the types of new entrants into the healthcare industry as well as influence how providers, clinicians, and other staff will work in the future.





In India, the last five years have seen consumer-facing ‘health tech’ being talked about and embraced by investors, government, and gradually by the public. Among educated consumers in urban areas, technology is largely gaining traction through online health service aggregators, telemedicine, e-pharmacies, and a few fitness apps. Existing methods are also being used to reinvent healthcare delivery in the form of online consults or chat-based basic healthcare service apps, especially during these unprecedented times.





From a social viewpoint, building greater trust in AI and protecting personal healthcare data will continue to be among the universal challenges. From an administrative standpoint, making it easier for AI to integrate with existing technology infrastructure will certainly help adoption.





For our country, we can conclude that these advanced technologies in healthcare are helping expand the human capacity rather than replacing human labour altogether. Putting us in a unique position to be the driver for AI and IoT technologies in healthcare space for national and international companies.





With large amounts of data and a burgeoning startup community, India has the opportunity to address many healthcare-related problems by using them. With new disruptions in healthcare innovations, we will soon be in a position to realise the benefits of these technologies on health outcomes.





Irrespective of a patient’s location or condition, an evolution of the AI, IoT, IoMT ecosystem will become progressively impactful. And even the most remote locations will benefit from better access to care as connected medical devices continue to find their way into the hands of both patients and clinicians.





Connected health and Artificial intelligence in healthcare is no more a thing of the future, it is slowly transforming the ‘now’ that we are living in.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",YourStory.com,Here’s how connected health and artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare industry,https://yourstory.com/2020/07/connected-health-artificial-intelligence-healthcare-industry

In an endeavour to deliberate on different aspects of healthcare system vis a vis ongoing corona pandemic, healthcare experts congregated at virtual healthcare innovation summit. Organised by Elets Technomedia, the Summit was a part of a three-day India Transformation Summit which witnessed key policymakers and experts discussing emerging governance challenges in the changing times. Prakash Kumar, Chief Executive Officer, Goods & Service Tax Network (GSTN), Government of India; Abhishek Singh, President & CEO, NeGD & MyGov, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India; Dr. Omkar Rai, Director General, Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India; Rajesh Aggarwal, Additional Secretary & Financial Advisor, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Government of India; Krishnan Chatterjee, Chief Customer Officer & Head of Marketing, SAP India, were among key participants.

In the virtual healthcare summit, experts and industry leaders discussed about how they are tackling the ongoing challenges and strategy to provide quality care maintaining revenue cycle. Through various panel discussions, they threw light on existing challenges and strategic changes need to overcome the same.

Participating in a panel discussion on how the ongoing pandemic has affected hospital business, Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, Founder Director, Ujala Cygnus Healthcare Services, said: “Every industry went through with phase where they had lots of disruptions. In healthcare industry, we were over confident thinking that we were very low risk industry. Risk taking appetite of stakeholder was low. Nobody was actually ready to take that plunge towards transforming the industry completely. There were only incremental changes. There were no real transformative changes in the industry in last many decades.”

“Covid-19 has pushed the stakeholders to take the plunge. The crisis has pushed everybody off the cliff. Now we have no option but to build an aeroplane on the way down to avoid crash. In healthcare we have best digital minds, digital solutions providers, but struggled to provide telehealth solutions. This pandemic has pushed button a lot on telemedicine and consultation,: he further said.

Whimpering about minimum allocation to healthcare, Dr. D K Gupta, Chairman & Managing Director, Felix Hospital, said: “Covid-19 has affected healthcare in a significant manner. Our Government is investing too little—1.28 percent of GDP on healthcare while developed countries spend over 10 percent. Even WHO suggest it should be around 4-5 percent. Most of the hospitals including small, medium sized and tertiary care are bearing the brunt. In larger hospitals, medical tourism has gone down. In small and medium sized hospitals, OPD and elective surgery have witnessed sharp decline. Cash flow has interrupted. IPD, OPD, radiology have been affected except emergency care. There has been disruption of supply chain due to lockdown.”

Another panellist Dr. Param Hans Mishra, Group Chief Executive Officer, Kailash Hospitals & Healthcare Ltd, highlighted issues of private stakeholders. He said: “This pandemic has pushed the healthcare industry in big turmoil. It has also brought to fore many challenges and opportunities towards us as healthcare managers and administrators. Cash flow has decreased as inflow of patients has gone down. Patients don’t want to visit hospital as they fear to catch corona infection. Number of elective surgery has gone down as well. Doctors and nurses are fighting with infection, risking their lives. We have devised strategies. We have segregated covid and non covid patients. Out of 10 hospitals we have dedicated one for covid patients.”

D S Chakravarthi, Chief Executive Officer, Prashanth Hospital, talked about contingency plan. “Till Covid-19 hit us hard, we never had any plan to deal with such situation. Those who have accepted the challenge and adapted accordingly have better chance to survive. We have to execute our changed business model in fast manner. We had planned for financial contingency to sustain in such kind of situation where there would be no or minimum business for some months,” he said.

“We leveraged telemedicine to provide services to our clients so that they won’t feel alienated. We tackled both covid and non covid patients. We looked upon threat as an opportunity. If we have to sustain then we have to strategise as per the situation and optimise processes and resources, accordingly,” he said.

Underlining the importance of innovative practices, Dr. Niraj Uttamani, Medical Director, Holy Family Hospital and Medical Research Center, said: “India has been hit hard by the pandemic. It has affected every sector including healthcare. Pay cuts and job loss have led to a very unstable situation in the healthcare sector. Healthcare is a hospitality industry where consumer is a patient. Emergency care can’t be deferred even in this pandemic. Covid-19 recovery will happen in see-saw manner. It will take many more months to back things on track.”

“Healthcare industry has to come up with absolute new innovations to cope up with new challenges. We have segregated covid and non-covid section as we have separate building. Same may not be possible for others. There has to be strategy to deal with different set of people as per their requirements vis a vis covid-19,” he further said.

Participating in another panel discussion on transforming healthcare ecosystem post covid-19, Dr. Rakesh Gupta, Chairman, Sarvodaya Hospital & Research Centre, said: “We faced challenge on front of supply chain—PPE kits, masks and all. Initially in Februrary, we didn’t have much to offer to covid patients. Then we started accumulating lots of global knowledge and we evolved soon. Then we created isolation facility, dedicated ultrasound, and ICU facility. Lockdown gave us time to prepare us well to provide better care to corona patients. With teams’ support, government facility, we provided best facility in Faridabad, Haryana. Tele consultations have its own limitations.”

Another panellist Dr. Venkat Ramana Sudigali, Director and CEO, Excell Multispeciality Hospital, opined that India beautifully tackled corona with lockdown proved very effective to strategise in better manner. “Lockdown in India has proved to be a good move in comparison to other countries. It provided time to prepare ourselves to take the pandemic head on. Stakeholders prepared themselves mentally and augmented infrastructural requirements. We are doing lot of remote consultations. Best part is that patients have started accepting it contrary to pre covid times. People will continue to avail teleconsulations post pandemic as well. Sometimes challenges bring up new opportunities as well and tele consultations is among one of them,” he said.

Talking about how his organisation has contributed to transform healthcare paradigm vis a vis corona, Dr Sandeep Chathrath, Regional CEO & Medical Director, Metro Hospitals & Heart Institute, said: “Covid-19 has totally transformed the healthcare scenario. The transformation has been 360 degree. Healthcare has become an essential core component of our country with impetus on infection control in a big way. We have observed supply chain management and clinical protocols for infection control as well as for the disease management. Metro has 11 hospitals and we have effectively implemented in all.”

“On the ground level, we have clinical management pathways for covid patients. Best thing is we have been able to control mortality rate and it is one of the best among various countries across the globe. We have also managed supply chain like availability of PPE and masks very effectively. Now, India is on its way to become manufacturing hub for PPEs,” he said.

Another panellist Joy Chakraborty, Chief Operating Officer, P D Hinduja Hospital listed steps undertaken to tackle patients. “We created a dedicated facility for corona patients and separate facility for non-covid patients as well. The month of April was little difficult to manage the scenario. But over a period of time, we have evolved and developed the system in such a way that peak come back to normal—slowly and steadily. Like most of the hospitals, we also have adopted tele consultations. We also provided home isolation facility to asymptomatic and aged patients. In addition, we also started 50-bed Covid care centre. It is one step below the dedicated covid hospital,” he said.

Dr Chandrashekhar T, Director, PD Hinduja Sindhi Hospital, said: “Occupancy and surgeries in the hospitals have dropped due to the pandemic. Non-covid patients have not been taken care of well by most of the hospitals. They were driving out non-covid patients. As a result death rate increased among such patients. Those patients could be easily saved by hospitals. Initially testing was an issue. But now we have PCR and rapid antigen testing too. We are taking care of both kinds of patients.”

Another panellist Dr Pankaj Gupta, Head Digital Health, Access Health International, termed data as key element to plan and strategise to cater patients with best facility. He also highlighted unorganised functioning of our care delivery system. He said: “Corona exposed the broken healthcare system. The system is falling short of number of beds, doctors, medicine, and supply. There is pretty much pressure on every part of the healthcare system today. The pandemic pushed us to the brink. We don’t know exactly about number of beds, para medical staff and other required information to get insight about the care delivery system.

“We need to optimise the process. Data becomes extremely important thing in such crisis like covid. Healthcare system also needs to evolve according to demand and expectations. Emphasis should be more on home healthcare services,” he held the opinion.

"Over the next five-seven years, the ownership profile of a lot of family-owned businesses will change in domestic formulations, says Chintan Kothari , Executive Director, and Head, Healthcare.When you talk about healthcare, I would like to break this into three parts: pharmaceuticals, healthcare delivery and medical equipment, devices and med tech. The macros that support the pharmaceuticals industry across domestic formulations, the exports-oriented businesses, APIs, contract manufacturing businesses as well as the large generic businesses that have multi geography businesses continue to remain quite strong.The Indian market continues to grow at about 10%. It is down from its hay days of about 14-15% but provides a beautiful linear growth of 10% to businesses on a consistent basis. Large brands with deep therapeutic focus are doing very well. The API businesses are doing very well driven by macro issues around China. Due to the environmental policies that China has implemented, a number of businesses in China have been shut down and that has created supply chain disruption. On top of that, you had compliance management issues that have hampered these businesses in China. There is also China’s own desire to continue to move up the value chain. So that presents a fantastic opportunity for Indian businesses, API, CDMO players, CMO businesses and the largecap and the mid-sized generic businesses with regulated markets.Those markets are starting to stabilise. The US market has stabilised quite well in the last few months. When you aggregate all of this clearly, that is driving very good investor interest. Investors are able to underwrite businesses and business plans with a reasonable degree of confidence and that is clearly driving the heightened M&A activity and heightened growth capital investments from private equity. What is also happening within the pharmaceutical ecosystem is that there is a generational change that is happening. Number of family businesses see this as a great opportunity to partner with capital providers and drive institutionalised businesses, enhance businesses, invest for the long term and clearly that is becoming a big theme as we look at private equities interest in Indian pharma.Coming back to healthcare. First of all, the healthcare industry in India is relatively newer compared to pharmaceuticals. It is a 20-25-year-old industry, especially private organised healthcare and external capital; especially private equity and growth capital has played a very important role in building out this industry. While the activity in healthcare has come down a little bit in the last year to two years due to various factors and we can touch upon that, we do believe that the scale of the industry and the under penetration clearly is creating large outcomes in healthcare. We do believe that investor interest will remain high even in healthcare.When you look at the ownership patterns in pharma versus healthcare, one big distinction that you see is, when you look at the top 50-75 pharma companies, the level of external ownership, i.e., private equity, private financing ownership compared to healthcare is significantly low. In healthcare, a lot of businesses, most large, mid-sized and small businesses have private equity ownership because of the financing nature of the business and that clearly will drive heightened deal making activity over the next few years in healthcare.Within pharmaceuticals, I would like to break it down into three or four key buckets. I think the first one is our own home market: the domestic formulations market. It is a large industry and still remains highly fragmented when you compare the nature of Indian domestic formulations market compared to the US or other large emerging markets. The top 10-15 players own about 50% market share. We believe that is likely to change over the next five-seven years.Consolidation activity has historically been slow. The last year has seen an inflection point in domestic formulations’ consolidations. We do believe over the next five-seven years, the ownership profile of a lot of family-owned businesses will change in domestic formulations. What has also happened in the last 10-15 years is that we have seen an emergence of new set of domestic formulations companies focussed on aggressive growth and aggressive investments and in those changing times, it is very important for some of the older businesses to sharpen up and partner with external investors and it is a great way of doing it.It need not be a controlled transaction. It could be a win-win partnership, a 50-50 partnership. It could be growth capital for further investments. So domestic formulations will see a different type of activity. When you come to our traditional largecap and midcap generic businesses, we do believe the activity will centre around capability building, technology additions and that will be largely outbound in nature. Most of these businesses have large India-centric businesses and they will continue to invest in India and grow. But the real investment in terms of capability and technology will happen largely outside of India and specifically in regulated markets; the US being the primary market for most of these businesses.I also believe that in the next two-three years unlike the last five or 10 years, if you would have seen there has been very little capital raise that has happened by the larger to midsized player; these are good businesses with strong balance sheets that are likely to go through a change. We do believe that a number of businesses will raise capital ahead of their needs and we will capitalise themselves strongly to continue to build these businesses.The investment cycle in pharma is not a two-three year cycle. It is a five, seven, 10 years cycle and hence it is very very important for the large to mid sized businesses to raise capital ahead of time and invest for the long term. When you see the level of capital raise that has happened in India in the last 10 to 15 years compared to what you see in China, we have literally raised in pharmaceuticals probably about a billion and a half to two billion dollars at best. China is at 20x just in the last four to five years. So the entire ecosystem needs to get energised and we need to build deep capabilities within India more. There is high risk in investing and hence businesses will be tempted to raise capital and will be keen to raise capital ahead of time.I think there is a set of businesses like API and CDMO that are centred around the export markets. I think that overall disruption in the global supply chain and some of the macro issues are actually clearly favouring these businesses. There is a strong investor interest and these businesses will continue to invest in capacity. We have already heard enough of the API disruption and the need for self-reliance; I think that plus the ability to build. India has historically been very strong at chemistry and huge manufacturing product development capabilities for export markets. We do believe that API and CDMO businesses will come back and do that at scale than what you have seen in the recent past.In the last three years, we have seen about $10 billion worth of activity within the healthcare ecosystem; about a 70:30 mix between pharmaceuticals and healthcare. Two-thirds of that activity has been driven by private investors. So clearly the scale of the activity has picked up compared to what it was a few years back. When I used that number of $10 billion, it excludes any outbound activity that has happened. So that has been one big change especially in pharmaceuticals where a lot of the activity has been domestic-centred.When you look at healthcare and look at the next two to three years, I expect over $5 billion of activity to take place within the healthcare ecosystem and those are conservative numbers from my standpoint. A lot of healthcare delivery businesses; hospitals, diagnostic chains, day care businesses, eye care, oncology, nephrology, have seen strong private investor interest. You will see exits happen in the next two to three years that will drive a large part of deal making activity within the healthcare delivery universe. Pharmaceuticals will continue to see a lot of activity there.I think there is a new space -- heath tech -- and you have seen the impact technology can make during these Covid times. There is going to be strong investor interest even within the health tech space where you are seeing capital build out some very interesting partnerships with exciting entrepreneurs and some very interesting businesses which will allow technology in combination with deep clinical protocols and skill sets to deliver healthcare to rural markets and at scale. I think the challenge in healthcare delivery has always been how do you take quality and deliver it in tier-2 markets, tier-3 markets and rural areas. The only way that gap can be bridged is through technology and we will see some interesting businesses.We will also see larger businesses in healthcare invest deeply in technology to enhance their offerings because they want to be capital efficient. You cannot go out and create physical infrastructure in every city, in every tier-2 city and in every rural market. The other challenge is there is a deep shortage of medical talent in healthcare and all of that can only be bridged through technology.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Economic Times,Expect to see strong investor interest in health tech space in next few years: Avendus Capital,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/expect-to-see-strong-investor-interest-in-health-tech-space-in-the-next-few-years-avendus-capital/articleshow/77022066.cms
"On this auspicious day of Doctor’s Day, Dr Sunil Reddy Bodanapu acknowledges and welcomes all the Doctors’ Colleagues in the global healthcare ecosystem, to collaborate and contribute in empowering the future of Healthcare with the right tools & technologies for unifying the ecosystem.

Dr. Sunil Reddy Bodanapu is bestowing healthtech- Nushift Technologies with the vision to empower the future of healthcare with digital unification and transformation.

Dr. Sunil Reddy Bodanapu - Founder and CEO of healthtech - Nushift Technologies is an alumni of Kakatiya Medical College & Indian School of Business. He is a visionary and passionate medical practitioner with expertise in Primary, Preventive & Emergency Care with over a decades’ experience in Healthcare Management. Being an integral part of the healthcare ecosystem, Dr. Sunil witnesses his colleagues and patients struggling to cope up with the challenges in the healthcare ecosystem .Lack of consistency in continuity of care for patients, insufficient Collaboration, Right Care not being accessed at Right Time, Lack of awareness in Proactive & Preventive Care are few challenges of our fragmented healthcare ecosystem which have a grave impact on health and wellbeing of people, at times leading to morbidity & mortality and also increase in cost due to delay in time of intervention.

Team at Nushift supported by Doyens of the medical fraternity as well as captains of the industry working on solutions which can unify the ecosystem,provide digital infrastructure to listen to the voice of the doctor's community and empower them to provide much better insights and awareness to the community. His vision for better health & wellbeing to people gave birth to – Nushift Technologies a futuristic healthtech platform.

Nushift Technologies will provide the digital health infrastructure in the form of an interconnected network of all the stakeholders comprising doctors ,para-medical staff, hospitals , healthcare enterprises, and patients. This infrastructure will help create a cohesive and connected, multi-dimensional structure which will support real preemptive healthcare, faster and better diagnosis and opinions, better knowledge/ information/ and seamless data sharing with utmost privacy & security among the stakeholders and finally better and quicker medical support to patients. It will bring digital transformation of the processes through various care plans and optimize the processes. The infrastructure will be created using various technologies which will be accessed using handheld devices, wearables, smart phones and web applications. This will enable Nushift Technologies to remove traditional barriers, which have been created by the lack of interoperability between stakeholders.

Dr. Sunil explains, “Through technology intervention in the healthcare ecosystem Continuity of Care or Care Continuum can be achieved by bringing various stakeholders together on a common platform. Continuum of Care is a concept involving an integrated system of care that guides and tracks patients over time through a comprehensive array of health services spanning all levels of intensity of care. It needs to begin with the First Point of Care, initial consultation to complete cure. Patients move from one place to another place for accessing care. Data interoperability is the biggest challenge and tracking the outcome of disease or patient is completely unknown. There is no seamless connectivity between stakeholders for the care continuum because some patients might be lost in the middle or have stopped taking treatment and there is no track. This solution helps in tracking the patient and treating the disease. Healthcare system works in silos and when a patient moves from a primary care physician to specialist, specialists again start with assessment which costs them time and money. Whereas, with continuity of care,key resources, time and most important is the lives of patients can be impacted.

He further adds “Nushift Technologies as a digital health platform, provides Collaborative & Integrated Care to patients. It is the result of multiple providers, communicating with each other about a patient's diagnosis and treatment. Many health conditions would require a multi-disciplinary approach towards a health problem and need collaboration. The outcome achieved together is always better than the decision of a single specialist. Healthcare system needs to have access to such collaboration among various healthcare providers across borders to give the best possible care, cost effective and time saving.

Dr. Sunil ensures that this healthtech provides self-assessment tools, health tracking, Analytics ,virtual access and appointment booking for Right Care at Right Time. He says “Time of intervention is imperative,any condition or disease if intervened early, invested resources can be saved and it ensures better life”.

He further mentioned that with the intervention of Nushift Technologies as a healthtech, healthcare can be transformed from reactive to Proactive Care. “Healthcare presumably related to illness or sickness Vs Wellbeing. Our body is an advanced machine with multi-disciplinary functions, But sadly we hardly do anything to maintain it. We always react to the illness rather than use preventive or proactive measures. With the help of right information, health education, tools and technology, health and wellbeing can be maintained. When people spend on preventive and proactive care, healthcare is affordable to all and everyone including the poor can afford that. Care for health has to begin the moment we are born till we die. We need to create this tremendous possibility to transform healthcare”. “Nushift Technologies, through its health education, promotion and personalized predictive analytics, educate and empower all stakeholders to take responsibility”.

“Today, Covid-19 has exposed the inability of the healthcare system, which is not ready to fight the pandemic like Covid-19”. Dr Sunil reiterates. “various stakeholders in Ecosystem needs to come together and unify to avoid fatalities related to health”

He urges that “It’s a Call to all the doctors, who are the leaders of the healthcare ecosystem, to participate in digital transformation of healthcare and Unify to provide accessible and affordable health to all.

Updated: Jul 20, 2020 22:31 IST

Over the last two decades, India and China have become significant players in the digital ecospace with profiles that are different but convergent. India may be the world’s back office, but its presence in products — software and hardware — is relatively small. China, on the other hand, is big in both domains. On the basis of a back-of-the envelope calculation, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of their digital sectors over the past two decades appear roughly comparable: India’s digital sector has grown, on average, annually by around 35%, while China has recorded 50%+ growth. However, thanks to compounding of the difference in growth rates over 20 years, the final picture today is different. In 2019, China’s digital economy claimed to have crossed $5 trillion or over a third of the country’s total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In comparison, India’s current digital economy is estimated around $300 billion, or nearly 12% of the GDP.

China’s digital surge has not only reinvented the economy, but has also bolstered the nation’s growth rate. In 2019, for instance, its digital sector’s 15.5% growth was the biggest contributor to the national GDP growth of 6.1%. Globally, China’s digital economy is second only to the United States (US). Although the US still dominates with 18 companies in top-30 digital companies by market capitalisation (2019), China has seven companies in the list, including Alibaba ($402 billion), and Tencent ($398 billion).

Recently, however, there are signs that this lopsided China-India’s digital paradigm might be correcting. China’s domestic digital economy is getting saturated and its attempt to expand globally is encountering increased resistance. Last month, India banned 59 Chinese apps. The United Kingdom (UK) reversed its decision to allow Huawei to operate 5G telecom system, and, in this, joined a number of western countries uneasy about Chinese digital exports.

In contrast, India’s digital economy seems to be getting a tailwind. Over the past three months, Jio, the largest Indian telecom operator, has managed to get Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of over $20 billion from 13 global investors for its platforms. Google has announced its intention to invest $10 billion in India’s digital economy over the next five to seven years. Foxconn, which assembles Apple phones here, intends to ramp up mobile production by investing $1 billion in India, already the world’s second-largest mobile manufacturer.

Despite the enormous global economic challenges, the four Indian technology majors have had healthy growth in their turnover during Q2/2020. While these may be early hopeful signs of gains in India’s digital journey, we need to acknowledge its strategic importance.

At this juncture, we need to study the Chinese strategy over the last two decades to become a digital superpower. In the late 1990s, China realised the potential of these emerging technologies and leveraged them. Foreign digital companies recieved permissions to ply their wares in China’s huge market, but these were withdrawn soon in a seemingly systematic manner, and the entire domestic digital ecospace reserved for its home-grown entities. Thus, China is the only major economy where Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google (FAAMG) are either absent or remain marginal players. Their Chinese clones took full advantage of a near-monopoly to grow exponentially. Meanwhile, China invested heavily in digital hardware technologies from chip-making to telecom systems and acquired companies and start-ups abroad. Thousands of Chinese students and researchers went to western technical institutions to specialise in these domains.

While many of the pathways China took to become a digital superpower are relevant to us, replicating them has since become more difficult. Having lost China, FAAAM are determined not let go of India. They have also become more possessive about their technologies. On our side, too, the ecosystem has often rendered only tepid support to the home-grown digital companies. Indian IT companies grow despite the government. There is little point in rediscovering the wheel — we should try and leap-frog into the future.

To this end, a strategy leveraging our market size and competence to foster alliances between domestic and foreign digital companies will serve us best. The government can and should make this possible by creating a positive and forward-looking framework and adopt best global practices, particularly on Intellectual Property Rights, data security, taxation, land acquisition and employment.

A high-powered inter-ministerial entity could be created to supervise the digital sector and accelerate decision-making. Non-resident Indian (NRI) techno-entrepreneurs should be encouraged to lead this synergy, particularly in creating research and development capacity in emerging technologies, clubbed as the Industrial Revolution 4.0. We also need to develop human resources through better academia-industry interface, adopt employment-friendly syllabi and train our workforce. We also need to appreciate that unlike the brick and mortar economy, digital technologies are less beholden to lure of either geo-economics or size.

If the country’s digital economy soars, it will have comprehensive spin-offs for the Indian economy and society — from faster growth to higher employment generation to greater self-reliance in an area, both critical at present and strategic in the future. These are reasons enough for us to act — particularly in the current challenging economic times.

"Vegrow, a Bengaluru-based agritech startup focussed on aggregating small farms, on Monday announced it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding from Matrix Partners India and Ankur Capital.





The round also saw participation from Better Capital, Titan Capital, as well as angel investors including Sanjiv Rangrass – CEO of ITC Ltd Agri Business Division, Rohit MA – Founder of Cloud 9, Ramakant Sharma – Founder of Livsapce and Amit Lakhotia – Founder of Park+.





Tarun Davda, Managing Director, Matrix India, said,





“Agriculture is one of India’s largest industries, and the lack of organisation in the space clearly outlines the vast opportunity available. Vegrow’s model of aggregating fragmented farms to help unlock economies of scale with technology-led interventions significantly increases the earning potential of their partner farmers.”





Image Source: Shutterstock





Founded by four IITians Praneeth Kumar, Shobhit Jain, Mrudhukar Batchu, and Kiran Naik, Vegrow is building an asset-light farm by partnering with small farms on a profit-sharing model. The startup said it increases the net earnings of partner farmers by leveraging technology across different stages of the farming cycle – it helps in crop planning, gives them access to quality inputs, monitors their adherence to practices, and ultimately sells their harvest to the right set of buyers.





Shobhit Jain, Co-founder, Vegrow added,





“From the humble beginning of farming ourselves, we now see a vision of becoming the world's largest farmer. We are partnering with farmers and building value chains for identified commodities. We are investing in farm tech and supply chain tech to help us realise a higher value for our farmers, all of this is rallied around a single point agenda which is to build and serve India’s largest farmer community.”





Both Praneeth and Shobhit started their professional career at the agri business division of ITC, while Mrudhukar and Kiran have had practical experience of farming.





Ritu Verma, Co-founder and Managing Partner, Ankur Capital, shared,





""We are excited to kick off our second fund by partnering with Vegrow. We have spent a lot of time in the agritech sector and most solutions do not get to the heart of the challenge - managing demand led production across fragmented farms. The team's depth of understanding the market, coupled with their approach to use technology to drive the scale is what sets them apart.”",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",YourStory.com,"[Funding alert] Agritech startup Vegrow raises $2.5M led by Matrix Partners India, Ankur Capital",https://yourstory.com/2020/07/agritech-startup-vegrow-matrix-partners-india-ankur-capital
"Dinero Innovations Pvt. Ltd, which operates neo-banking startup Finin, has raised money as part of its pre-Series A round of funding.

The round in Bengaluru-based Finin has been led by early-stage investor Unicorn India Ventures, it said in a statement.

Other participants in the round include PointOne Capital and Astir Ventures. The funding sum was not disclosed.

This is the third investment from Unicorn India’s second fund, which has a corpus of Rs 400 crore.

Previously, the investment firm had committed capital from the second fund to Sascan Meditech Pvt. Ltd and blockchain-based chit fund management platform ChitMonks.

Finin was set up last year by Suman Gandham and Sudheer Maram.

The company says its artificial intelligence-based platform helps customers analyse their spends, automate savings, and advises them on investment opportunities.

It will use the capital it has raised to scale up its marketing operations, as well as increase customer acquisition and hiring efforts.

It will also use the capital to build out partner networks. Currently, Finin’s product is in a beta phase, with the company to take it live in August.

“A neo-bank startup like ours is made with the purpose to bridge gaps using technology and help people develop a better relationship with money by simplifying antiquated banking services,” Gandham said.

Unicorn India managing partner Bhaskar Majumdar said the firm was confident of its investment in Finin because of the larger potential of neo-banking within the larger financial-technology space.

Unicorn India has also invested in Open, a small business-focused neo-bank.

Finin is the latest in the fast-growing neo-banking segment to attract investor attention.

Earlier this month, the teenager-focussed Walrus raised funding in a pre-seed exercise led by early-stage venture firm Better Capital. Other participants included Myntra co-founder Raveen Sastry and Taxiforsure founder Raghunandan G.

In April, Jitendra Gupta-founded Jupiter raised $2 million (around Rs 15 crore) in a top-up funding round from British venture capital firm Hummingbird Ventures and United States-based Bedrock Capital.

Entellus Business Solutions Pvt. Ltd, which operates enterprise-focussed neo-banking platform Nupay, raised funding in a seed investment round led by startup incubator and accelerator Venture Catalysts in January.

In the same month, EpiFi Technologies Pvt. Ltd raised $13.2 million in seed funding at a valuation of around $50 million from investors such as Sequoia Capital, Ribbit Capital and Hillhouse Capital.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",VCCircle,Unicorn India Ventures leads pre-Series A funding for neo ...,https://www.vccircle.com/unicorn-india-ventures-leads-pre-series-a-funding-for-neo-bank-finin/
"The coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered businesses worldwide and led to a crash in public markets, has made venture capital funds extremely cautious when it comes to spending.





But even as startup funding slows down in the aftermath of COVID-19, Irvine, California-based Season Two Ventures is scouting for potentially impactful business-to-business (B2B) startups that can help propel a second wave of growth led by technology.





Season Two Ventures is a $100 million early-stage VC focused on deep tech/AI-enabled B2B solutions for large businesses in healthcare, fintech, retail, energy, and utilities. The fund aims to invest between $1 and 3 million in B2B startups and partner with founders who have unique insights, from inception through all phases of growth.





Sajan Pillai, CEO and Managing Partner, Season Two Ventures

It aims to provide global market access to companies with the potential to solve the unmet needs of 1,000 enterprises worldwide.





“We will continue to invest in Indian B2B startups as [entrepreneurs in] the country have shown growing promise of creating impactful solutions that can be applied for the whole world,” says Sajan Pillai, Founder of Season Two Ventures, in a conversation with YourStory.





Sajan was formerly CEO of UST Global, a technology services company where he is credited with growing the firm from a 20-member team to more than 25,000 people.





Season Two Ventures has already invested in about five startups in India – Uvik Technologies, Ambee, Lil’Goodness, Svast - and its involvement typically spans the seed to Series B stages, around four to five years. The fund believes that its strength lies in adding value during the early stages of a startup.





Opportune time for investments

According to YourStory Research data, funding in Indian startups stood at $4.16 billion for the first six months of 2020, a decline of 14.5 percent when compared to the same period in 2019. The real deceleration started in the second quarter of 2020 as COVID-19 made a deeper impact and funding witnessed a steep fall.





But despite the bleak funding environment, Sajan is confident about going ahead with his plan of investing in startups. He believes this is an opportune time to invest in B2B startups in India as these new-age companies have all the essentials to create the right impact.





He says the world is going through a fundamental change due to COVID-19, and consumer behaviour has changed forever, with technology being the only enabler.





“India will become a prominent destination, and come out with solutions in digital services, data privacy, cyber security, and more,” Sajan says. “We might have the second great technology opportunity after the first wave of IT Services.”

Focusing on impactful startups

The key focus areas of Season Two Ventures as far as startup investments are concerned are healthcare, financial services, retail, energy, and sustainability. “We are looking at startups that can deliver impactful solutions,” Sajan says.





The big advantage Season Two Ventures has is that it is headquartered in the US and offers cross-border functionality, giving Indian B2B startups a stronger entry point into a large market like North America.





“Having led a startup myself, I know that entrepreneurship is not only about how to succeed but also about how one recovers after a failure,” Sajan says.





He believes that the experience of the 14-member team at Season Two Ventures, which includes both investment and advisory roles, will be an effective guide for the startups.

Connecting with global enterprises

The critical thing for B2B startups in India is to get access to large enterprises, which is typically a hard nut to crack. Many B2B startups in India struggle to break into the list of global 500 companies and also take a longer time to reach a revenue of $10-15 million.





Typically, a network effect has been seen among enterprises when they adopt or buy a new technology solution. So, executives from a particular industry will rely more on peer inputs than external voices.





Season Two Ventures also bring in the heft of the CXO network connect, making it easier for B2B startups to get access to enterprise clients.





“Only ideas are not enough as the entrepreneur needs to have incredible knowledge of the market,” says Sajan, adding that it is critical for B2B startups to have execution skills.





Sajan strongly believes the timing is right to showcase Indian B2B startups to the world, much like what Israel has done over the last decade.





Season Two Ventures has till now been primarily engaged with startups in Bengaluru, Kochi, and Telangana. It is now looking at other regions such as Mumbai, Chennai, and NCR.





Sajan believes a confluence of things is putting India in a position of advantage, including the digital platform culture, experience of dealing with global enterprises, and large technical talent pool.





“India enjoys a high degree of trust when compared to other nations for overseas investors,” Sajan says.

"The investment will enable StyleDotMe to enter the global fashion retail market and scale its overall business.

Indian fashion tech startup StyleDotMe today announced that it has raised a total of Rs 3.5 crore in a Pre-series A funding round led by Survam Partners followed by Bobby Kothari, Director Jewelex India as a Strategic Investor and with continued participation from existing investors from IAN (Indian Angel Network).

StyleDotMe’s powerful Augmented Reality technology, mirrAR has revolutionized the Jewellery Industry by enabling virtual try ons in real-time. With a strong client portfolio consisting of over 150 jewelers like Tanishq, Kalyan Jewellers, Senco, HazooriLal Legacy, etc. across 28 cities, mirrAR is now ready to enter the global market.

mirrAR helps jewellers sell without having any real physical inventory, over and above providing a great experience for their customers both offline and online. While the offline in-store solution allows shoppers to virtually try-on jewellery and make selections in a contactless manner, the webAR solution facilitates try ons for customers across the Globe via their laptops/mobile phones. Especially during this pandemic, where social distancing and sanitization is the new normal, mirrAR allows brands to open up their digital stores & also give a world-class seamless & safe experience to their customers across channels. With the integration, brands have been able to increase their leads and conversions & multiply their customer’s engagement!

StyleDotMe is also one of the first few companies across the Globe to have introduced the Real-time Markerless Hand Tracking technology in mirrAR. With this technology, consumers can try on rings & bracelets virtually, without having to follow any additional steps for calibration or adding markers to their hands for tracking. Jewelers will now be able to display their entire catalog for virtual try on in mirrAR including Earrings, Necklaces, Sets, Rings, Bracelets, which is an offering exclusively available via mirrAR in the Augmented Reality Industry.

After significantly adding value to the Jewellery Industry, mirrAR by StyleDotMe is all set to launch for the Eyewear & Watches Industry!

According to Meghna Saraogi, Co-Founder & CEO, “We, at StyleDotMe, truly believe that our product has the potential of reinventing how consumers shop in today's world and that conviction drives everything we do and we’re excited to have found a set of partners whose ideals align with ours. Their backing and the experience will allow us to expand in the global market and we are looking forward to capturing almost 50% of the market share across the biggest jewellery hubs: India, Middle-East, and the U.S. by 2025. Through our product mirrAR, we are looking forward to revolutionizing the whole shopping experience of a person through virtual and contactless try-on. We are also extremely happy to see how our existing investors have re-invested in us, this shows we are going in the right direction and will always have their support.”

Ambarish Raghuvanshi, IAN Lead Investor says, “IAN, the pioneers in angel and early investing in India have supported StyleDotMe from inception and have participated in several rounds of fundraising since then. StyleDotMe is now poised to attain great heights with its emphasis on AR and VR and IAN investors continue to provide investing, advisory, and business assistance to StyleDotMe in its growth phase.”

Akshay Munjal, Survam Partners says, “We are delighted to partner with StyleDotMe as a lead investor, in their mission of transforming shopping experiences for customers and helping retailers drive their business in these tough times through their powerful AR technology. Meghna & the team have an in-depth understanding of the challenges that the retailer community faces today & the need-gap that exists from a shopper's lens. Their customer-centric approach to innovation & that passion to revolutionize the industry is what has drawn us to StyleDotMe.”

Bobby Kothari, Director, Jewelexsays “We're drawn to the idea, StyleDotMe's valuable offerings and also their passion for taking their product global. We are happy to see such a powerful technology aimed at enhancing the traditional workings of the retail sector come out of India. We’re thrilled to contribute to the brand’s future growth and expansion in the vast, underpenetrated segment and are absolutely excited to be a part of their journey, which has worldwide potential”

Emerging technologies like Augmented Reality and Virtual reality are radically changing the way people respond to experiences. According to a report by Gartner inc, 100 million users will shop in AR online and in-store by the end of this year. In India, they expect the Immersive Media market to grow to $6.5 billion by 2022 while Augmented Reality is estimated to grow to $5.9 billion and Virtual Reality to $0.5 billion by 2022.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",BW Businessworld,"Augmented Reality Based Technology Company, Styledotme Raises Rs 3.5 Crore, Pre-series A Funding To Revolutionize The Future Of The Retail Industry",http://bwdisrupt.businessworld.in/article/Augmented-Reality-Based-Technology-Company-Styledotme-Raises-Rs-3-5-Crore-Pre-series-A-Funding-To-Revolutionize-The-Future-Of-The-Retail-Industry/20-07-2020-299230

Tech-giant Google Monday announced plans to invest $10 billion in India over the next 5-7 years by way of equity investments, partnerships and other arrangements to “accelerate digitisation” in the country.

The announcement assumes particular significance given the impending gap in the country’s tech investment ecosystem following the Centre’s clampdown on Chinese technology firms.

During our interaction, @sundarpichai and I spoke about the new work culture that is emerging in the times of COVID-19. We discussed the challenges the global pandemic has brought to areas such as sports. We also talked about the importance of data security and cyber safety. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) July 13, 2020

How will Google invest from the $10-billion fund?

Google said its $10-billion fund would focus on areas such as enabling affordable access to the Internet and to information for every Indian in their own language; building new products and services in segments like consumer tech, education, health and agriculture; empowering businesses, especially small and medium ones, to transform digitally; leveraging technology and artificial intelligence for digital literacy, outbreak predictions, and support for rural economies.

These investments will be made through a mix of equity investments, partnerships, operations, infrastructure and ecosystem investments. These include Google’s existing projects such as Internet Saathi for spreading awareness of the Internet in rural villages and an artificial intelligence-based flood forecasting system, among others.

Is this a reaction to the curbs on Chinese companies?

While the fund may have been in the works since before the clampdown on Chinese companies, the development did present an opportunity for tech majors like Google to grow their share in India’s internet pie.

Big technology companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Twitter are, in any case, prohibited from doing business in China. Potential hurdles for Chinese companies investing in India could provide better prospects for American giants to strengthen their position in a market which has the second-most Internet users in the world.

What are Google’s top investments in India so far?

Google has invested in various startups and ventures in India through several of its investment vehicles. On November 1, 2013, the company invested Rs 3.13 crore in Sana Ventures in the seed funding round, and Rs 3 crore in Agastya International Foundation.

Since then, it has invested in $45,000,000 in Dunzo and Rs 39 crore in the online education portal CueMath.

In its latest investment on June 24, Google put $27,500,000 in the Series E funding of a Gurugram-based company Aye Finance.

How does this compare with Google’s global investments in tech ventures?

Compared with its global investments, investment in India dwarves, but the $10 billion as part of the ‘Google for India Digitization Fund’ will boost Indian companies in Google’s portfolio. Between January 1, 2010 and July 13 this year, Google and its venture capital arms have invested in more than 900 companies globally. Among these, it has the maximum investments of $1.5 billion in Indonesian multi-service startup Gojek, $1 billion in ride-sharing firm Lyft, $1.4 billion in its rival Uber, and $1 billion in Elon Musk’s SpaceX.

How does this announcement figure in big-tech’s outlook on India?

Google’s investment plan is in line with big-tech’s bullish outlook on India. Earlier this year, Amazon said it would invest an additional $1 billion in India. This was followed by a marquee investment announcement of $5.7 billion by Facebook in the country’s largest telecom company Reliance Jio. Last month, Microsoft’s venture fund M12 said it would open an office in India to pursue investment opportunities focusing on B2B software startups.

"As many as 16 technology projects, including two from Andhra Pradesh, in the areas of testing, tracking and treatment of COVID-19 have been selected for funding by the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC).

The technologies selected for support are in the areas of manufacture of test kits, sanitisers, ventilators, PPEs, masks and effluent treatment at COVID-19 hospitals which are a result of research conducted by universities and institutions.

The NRDC, an enterprise under DSIR, Union Ministry of Science and Technology, plays a vital role by acting like a bridge between industry and institutions by identifying viable innovations and giving them to entrepreneurs for taking up commercial production.

Proposals sought

The NRDC had invited proposals from innovators across the country under its DSIR grants-in-aid promotional programme for development of technologies for commercialisation (PDTC) for up-scaling the COVID-19-related technologies. “A three-member external technology expert committee short-listed the 16 projects from among 65 entries for funding based on their technical feasibility and relevance,” NRDC CMD H. Purushotham told The Hindu.

They include IIT, Delhi, Sahajanand Technologies Private Limited, IDEMI, Mumbai and INM Indian Navy, Mumbai. The two proposals from AP are atmospheric movable cabin alternative to PPE (SRIT, Anantapur) and high capacity disinfectant spraying machine with auto-retractable hose heel for use in large public spaces (Ramachandra College of Engineering, Eluru).

Early production

“We will fund the selected projects and the researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs have to begin the work for further development and commercial production at the earliest. Our second component is Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection and technology transfer and we help in the identification of prospective clients for commercialisation of the innovations developed by the research institutes. We are currently working with over 500 institutes, including private entities, for the technology transfer programme and have already filed about 2,000 patents and transferred about 5,000 technologies in India and abroad particularly to MSMEs and startups,” he said.

“The financial support is given for development of COVID-19 technologies in the area of tracking, testing and treatment, covering process scale up, pilot plant studies, validation/authentication of the product, registration of the product with regulatory authorities, conducting field trials and generation of toxicology data,” he added.",2020-07-21,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///////yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",The Hindu,Two A.P. tech projects to fight COVID-19 picked for Central funding,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/two-ap-tech-projects-to-fight-covid-19-picked-for-central-funding/article32107054.ece
"Startup funding dropped by 29% in the first six months of 2020 to $4.2 billlion compared to $5.9 billion in the corresponding period last year, due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data by venture capital industry tracker Tracxn.

Only 443 startups were funded in the January-June period this year against 725 in H1, 2019. This year also put the spotlight on certain sectors like alternative lending, payments and test preparation tech and generated a lot of interest and funding from investors, according to Tracxn.

While funding in the startup ecosystem was impacted by the covid-19 crisis and the overall economic uncertainty, the restrictions put on direct investments by Chinese investors into Indian companies may put an immediate freeze on funding, impacting small and large internet firms alike.

Even as the economic situation worsened, some startups however managed to raise significant funding this year.

Test preparation tech startups saw the biggest jump in funding with 821 firms raising $666.2 million, up 538%. Ed-tech startup Byju's raised about $100 million from Mary Meeker’s technology fund Bond, taking the valuation of the start-up to $10.5 billion. It had earlier in the year raised $200 million from Tiger Global. The new funding makes Byju’s the second most valued startup in India.

Startups like Sachin Bansal’s Navi, Lendingkart and InCred dominated the alternative lending segment that saw a total funding of $704.5 million, up 67%.

In the Mom & Baby Care segment, 531 start-ups managed to raise $327 Mn, up by 3031%. In 2019, there were no start-ups in this segment that raised funding.

In the payments segment, 989 companies, including Paytm, Pine Labs and Billdesk Overall, raised $347.7 million, down 37% from the first half of 2019.

Three startups – FirstCry, Nykaa and Pine Labs- entered the unicorn club this year compared to six last year. Unicorns are startups with a valuation of 1 billion and above.

Sequoia Capital and Accel were the top venture capital firms, while Steadview Capital and FMO were the top private equity firms in H1'20.

VC investors have been warning startups to control costs and avoid expansion in a bid to boost profitability.

On Tuesday, Sequoia India said it has received commitments worth $1.35 billion from limited partners for two new India- and South-East Asia (SEA)-focussed funds—a $525-million venture fund, and a $825-million growth fund.

“We are excited about the depth of opportunities in this region, which is undergoing a massive technology-led transformation. The startup ecosystem in both India and SEA has come a very long way in the last few years; the market gets deeper and the crop of founders, and their achievements, becomes more impressive each year,"" said Shailendra J. Singh, managing director, Sequoia Capital (India) and SEA, in a blog post.
