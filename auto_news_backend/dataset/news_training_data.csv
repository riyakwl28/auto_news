13,"In the course of the two years, we have seen a consistent increment in the percentage of adoption of AI in India. Given the Indian government’s ongoing focus on building up a plan for artificial intelligence, it is recommended to apply strengths (deep analysis of AI applications and implications) to determine (a) the state of AI innovation in India, and (b) strategic insights to help India survive and thrive in a global market with the help of AI initiatives.Advances in artificial intelligence and data analytics are pushing development in numerous parts of the world. China, for instance, has committed $150 billion towards its objective of turning into a world chief by 2030. And while the United States government is putting just $1.1 billion in non-classified AI research, its private sector is burning through billions in fields from finance and healthcare to retail and defense. This is changing various segments.There is developing AI interest, however, as India begins to contribute extra resources and deploy new AI applications. This year, the national government has multiplied its investment in its innovation program known as Digital India to Rs 3,063 crore (or $477 million) so as to support progress in AI, machine learning and 3-D printing. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has built up an AI taskforce to create strategies that encourage advancement in these zones. Its recent report underlined the requirement for more prominent investment, more AI research, patching up of school educational programs and extra advancement by the private segment.Similarly, like Google, Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon are fighting to serve the cloud computing and machine learning needs of the US government, the following three to five years may lead to a similar dynamic within India. As the Indian government pushes for digitization and orders more AI activities, private firms will run to win huge agreements, adding to the pool of assets to grow new innovations and turn out new AI and data science-related new companies.Mayank Kapur, CTO of Indian AI startup Gramener, says that the legislature is as yet the biggest potential customer for data science services in the nation. Different experts have articulated that an ever-increasing number of Indian startups and built up tech firms are starting to execute AI in their products and services.Advanced programming enables health providers to evaluate symptoms, diagnose disease, and plan appropriate treatments. As indicated by writer Prakash Mallya, the healthcare industry is relying on AI to adjust the precision of medical predictions and pick a fitting line of treatment. AI is an approach to improve the quality of care while likewise containing clinical expenses. Past diagnosis and treatment, AI methods and ML algorithms can likewise adjust interventions in public health policy across the country",ai
14,"In the Healthcare industry, as the magnitude of data piles up, so does the necessity of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Systems. With the rising trend of value-based healthcare, clinicians must have tools at their disposal that can help them sift through mountains of records that can sometimes date back to decades.According to a report, a third of deaths in the US are caused due to medical errors and inaccuracies. This justifies the need for deeper analysis and reporting of accessible data on the patient, with members of the healthcare community. Although one cannot eliminate these errors from the domain, having a system that minimizes these acts as a safety net. Hence CDS is a must for a paradigm shift in this industry.Since the 1980s when it was first used, it has quite evolved much. Now it is administered via Electronic Health Records (EHR) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. This has been made possible by increasing the global adoption of HER with advanced capabilities, e.g. FitBit. These systems comprise of 3 distinct parts: Base (pre-defined algorithms), Inference Engines (output is generated based on patient’s clinical data) and Communicator (where interaction is made with user/patient). The only challenge one can face here is poor implementation as it will lead to alarm fatigue and clinician burnout. While benefits encompass safety of patients, increased adherence to guidelines and care pathways, prevention of Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) errors, cost containment by suggesting cheaper alternatives, support for clinical and diagnostic coding, imaging, ordering of procedures and tests, and patient triage, qualitative documentation, etc., certain barriers need to be addressed by stakeholders.",ai

23,"Technology has transformed many industries across the world and changed the way companies act. Mining is one such industry that is maturing over the last few decades on the back of an ever-increasing demand for mined resources on one side, and a need for sustainable mining on the other. The mining industry currently faces a unique set of challenges – improving production and reducing costs while protecting the health and safety of their workers, safeguarding fixed assets and environmental conservation. Miners often put their lives at risk, travelling deep underground in dangerous conditions to bring these precious elements to the surface.The mining industry’s contribution (excluding petroleum and natural gas) to India’s GDP is only around 2-3% in 2018-19, a sharp contrast to India’s true potential, being a geologically rich country. A significantly higher contribution to GDP will go a long way in achieving India’s dream of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy, as evinced across economies like South Africa where mining contributed 7.5% to GDP, and Australia where it is 6.99% to GDP.Automation and Digitalisation are touted to be the most defining mining industry trends of the 21st century across the globe, aimed at enhancing productivity and addressing the challenges faced by the mining industry.Innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and the industrial internet of things (IoT) all have the potential to save the sector an estimated $373 billion and hundreds of lives by 2025 by automating machinery operation, planning and scheduling, facilitating predictive maintenance, improving man, material and asset traceability, harnessing the power of real-time data and analytics, and providing visibility across the mine-to-market value chain.

26,"While India is one of the largest producers of food crops in the world, a lot of this - 16 per cent to be exact - is wasted every year due to inadequate infrastructure and supply chain management. The cold storages aren't equipped to reduce food wastage even when a large number of India's population goes hungry and the country continues to slip lower in the Global Hunger Index. The need of the hour is some disruptive technology that can address this problem. That is where QZense comes in. Founded by Rubal Chib and Srishti Batra, this Bengaluru-based start-up has developed a device, using machine learning and IoT, to detect the shelf life and ripeness of agricultural produce.The start-up has developed two devices, which use the sense of smell and sight to detect the quality of produce. ""The devices will study their internal composition and biochemical processes to assess the health of fresh food,"" says Rubal. The two devices include a handheld scanner and a data logger. ""The scanner, called QScan, is portable and can be used to grade and sort the fresh produce. For example, it can tell the retailer about the level of sweetness in fruits. The loggers can be installed in cold storages or in the vehicles transporting produce. It has in-built sensors to detect the gases and compounds produced by the fruits and vegetables. It will alert the user when the rate of degradation is increasing so that the food can be distributed sooner,"" adds Rubal.",iot

According to Gartner, with the total public cloud services spend in India at $2.4 bn in 2019, India has recorded the third-highest growth rate of 24.5% in 2019 after China (33%) and Indonesia (29%).It is expected that by 2022, over 60% of all mid and large enterprises would have migrated some of their apps and workloads on the cloud. The cloud industry in India is expected to grow at the rate of 30%+ YoY with the largest share being for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).Eg., an organization, instead of buying a CRM package and procuring hardware to run it and deploying IT manpower to manage it, are preferring solutions on the cloud, so that they can avoid capex and grow easily on demand and scale down whenever required, without worrying about the uptime issues.During this adoption of public cloud, organizations are most concerned about safety and reliability. Hence, a Direct Connect Service, wherein, an enterprise can have a leased line/MPLS connection to cloud service providers instead of the unreliable and unsecured internet, is helping cloud adoption.GPX has been providing this service of Dedicated Connect for Amazon(AWS), Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud for the last three years with over 60 enterprises using this service at the GPX DC.",dc

India is all set to join the GPS global market and compete with players like GLONASS (Russia), BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (China) and Galileo (Europe).A new chip that supports the NavIC needs to be developed in order to put the navigation system to use on smartphones. ISRO is reportedly engaging in discussions with chipmakers like Qualcomm and Broadcom to that end.NavIC has been claimed by ISRO to have greater accuracy as compared to GPS, the reason being that NavIC works on dual-frequency bands (S and L) while Global Positioning System works only on the L band.

86,"To turn data-driven governance from dream to reality, smart cities have taken a leaf out of the corporate playbook. Each of the 100 smart cities is in the process of appointing a chief data officer (or CDO). The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has asked each municipality to build its own “data cell”, appoint departmental “data champions”, and push for “data alliances” under the Smart Cities Mission’s “Data Maturity Assessment Framework”. All these efforts are aimed at improving governance by understanding data and patterns at the city level.Almost all cities have submitted their self-assessments to the ministry and over Rs 13,000-crore worth of IT and digitisation tenders have been put out so far. When they are up and running, these projects will funnel 2,000 to 6,000 terabytes (TB) of data into the cities’ Integrated Control and Command Centres from CCTV cameras, traffic systems, and water flow sensors, among others.There are hurdles, of course. For one, cities need a data policy without which CDO will find it hard to push through. Moreover, mapping data and using it in governance is uncharted territory for most, including some CDOs. As things stand, lateral entry for the CDO’s position, too, is not allowed.",industry

89,"Samsung had ceased to make mobile phones in China, the company revealed on Wednesday. The company has been withdrawing from handset manufacturing in the country for a while now as its position in the Chinese market is not strong, whereas business conditions are better elsewhere.Samsung used to run multiple phone manufacturing facilities in China. About a year ago, the company shut down its plant in Tianjin, then it closed its plant in Huizhou in mid-2019. Recently, the world’s No. 1 maker of smartphones ceased production of handsets in another factory in Huizhou. Equipment used at its facilities in China was relocated to plants in other countries, such as India and Vietnam.There are at least three major reasons why Samsung decided to stop making phones in China. First of all, its market share in the country has recently dropped from 15% in mid-2013 to 1% as of today, as the company lost market share to companies like Huawei and Xiaomi (based on data from Counterpoint). Secondly, rising labor costs in China make the country less attractive for large corporations. Thirdly, the ongoing trade war between China and the US poses risks for Samsung as goods produced in China may be subject to tariffs in the United States.",cc

Nokia has been the sole provider of VoLTE technology to Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, and Bharti Airtel.With the new contract, Airtel is introducing a multi-vendor approach to its network for VoLTE service in the country. It had awarded a large VoLTE deal worth Rs 402 crore to Finnish telecom gear maker Nokia, ET had previously reported.Airtel is offering its VoLTE service across 22 circles in India.

In the last interim budget, the government’s announcement to create 1 lakh digital villages in the next 5 years is a great initiative in that direction,” says Anand Kumar Bajaj, Founder & CEO, PayNearby.Despite the effort to make India a cashless or less-cash society, cash is needed to make almost every payments – for example right from morning, persons like newspaper vendor, milkman, maid servant etc. visit us and all of them accept cash. So, to go cashless, everyone has to be empowered to accept payment in any mode other than cash and need mechanism to live without cash a habit.“Though our country has taken rapid strides towards financial inclusion in the last few years, we are still largely a cash based economy. More than 45 per cent of the country’s bank accounts have no transactions and only 13 per cent Indian adults borrow through formal channels. The creation of a regulatory, social, commercial and infrastructure framework that will help in the creation of the last mile access of financial and other primary services to the larger India is thus one of the primary needs of the subcontinent,” said Bajaj.",cloud

168,"As Internet of Things continues to permeate various aspects of daily life and market functions alike, analysts are now examining the value of the technology for developing solutions. In India, these applications are being assessed primarily in the context of smart cities, according to KPMG. The Smart Cities Mission in India has not only made great strides in terms of urban development across India, but has simultaneously accelerated the adoption of a number of Industry 4.0 technologies. The principle behind smart cities is to enhance efficiency through greater connectivity.A number of contemporary technologies are relevant in this regard, including data analytics, automation and artificial intelligence (AI). One field that has a particularly strong impact on the functioning of smart cities is Internet of Things (IoT), given its role in enhancing the connectivity in mobile devices.The technology has a number of applications in transport, urban development and a number of other domains. According to Big Four accounting and advisory firms, these applications have brought about substantial growth in the IoT market across India. “Adoption of smart solutions has gained a large traction in the ‘Smart City’ initiative across India. With a large volume of sensor- based infrastructure, citizen centric solutions, big data analytics solutions being taken up in most smart cities, the Internet of Things ecosystem provides the right platform to manage and monitor modern urban landscapes,” explains Ramendra Verma, Partner and Head of Government Advisory at KPMG.Growth of the IoT market in India corresponds with IoT growth across the world, which has ballooned over the last few years. Where the total number of IoT connected devices across the globe stood at just over 15 billion in 2015, there are currently just under 27 billion connected devices in the world.",iot
169,"India is witnessing the IoT revolution and is being deployed across various verticals including agriculture. With the advancement in technology at hand, the opportunities for IoT to revolutionise the agricultural sector is magnanimous. According to IoT India Congress 2018, Indian IoT market is expected to grow from $3 billion to $9 billion by 2020 across sectors such as telecom, health, vehicles, homes, entire cities and manufacturing floors and computers. The pace of India’s digital revolution is proof that the role of IoT in India is indispensable.With agriculture predicted to contribute about $1 trillion of India’s GDP by 2022, it is imperative that India shifts its focus to revolutionising this sector. To achieve this growth, we need to embrace the technologies at our disposal. There is a huge opportunity for the Internet of Things (IoT) to transform the methodologies applied and processes followed with automation to make operations more efficient, leading to better crop yields.Plagued by the lower production, high cost of cultivation with the added insufficient or infertile soil, India is losing its generation of farmers. The Economic Survey 2018 predicted the downfall of agricultural workers to 25.7 percent by 2050. With wireless connectivity bridging masses in this digital revolution, it is imperative that we leverage this connectivity to aid the agriculture sector to flourish. The emerging technologies can transform the agricultural landscape to expand into long-term successes for future generations.Several technologies are being integrated with the traditional farming processes to enable smart agriculture practises for farmers. With the implementation of IoT, farmers will be empowered with data-driven intelligence.This will enable them to live track the weather and environment, real-time asset management, equipment controlling, selection and harvesting of crops, monitoring crop health with drone and imagery technology, soil nutrition level and water content monitoring in the crop fields, quick communication exchange with agriculture experts located remotely, predicting pricing trends, and a plethora of other extensive benefits. If we look at the scenario today, IoT is changing the landscape of the traditional weather stations into automated-wireless units delivering highly accurate climate information with data analytics for the core weather predictions.",iot

""When we are talking about whether we are ready to get into this whole artificial intelligence (AI) journey, I think we are ready and we are looking at it and going there in stages. I think the first stage is where the Supreme Court has said that privacy is a fundamental right (and) that should be kept in mind,"" said Gopalakrishnan S, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and IT (Meity), at a FICCI event in New Delhi on Wednesday. The event was attended by a panel comprising government officials and industry experts. All big companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google are biggest consumers of AI and at the same time their usage of technologies leads to concerns as well, Gopalakrishnan added. ""People are concerned when it is something like Google or Facebook, but when it is something like Amazon or Netflix people are not that scared. The difference is very simple to see. When you are using Amazon or Netflix, you are a consumer and you are benefitted. When you are on Google, somebody else is the advertiser. There is a conflict of interest and there it leads to internal debate on how should data be handled,"" he said.The Meity joint secretary also said that very soon a law around protection of personal data will be in place to protect the privacy of people, which will soon be much more vulnerable with deployment of large number of sensors within the house and outside. Internet companies use AI technology to analyse personal data of people connected online and push products before them that they may buy. ""Privacy is basic. Whatever is happening so far is without any concerns for privacy,"" Gopalakrishnan said.

205,"At its annual strategic review, NASSCOM announced that India’s IT-BPM industry grew 9.2 percent in 2018-19, during which it created 170,000 new jobs across large and mid-sized enterprises. Most of the job creations happened in the field of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), data analytics, and cybersecurity, as companies across the spectrum ramped up their investments in digital transformation and innovation. NASSCOM also revealed that India is the world’s third largest tech startup hub, with over 7,000 product and service startups in operation right now. Growth in the startup sector was the “key highlight” of 2018. The year also witnessed the emergence of eight new unicorns, and the country’s first SaaS unicorn (Freshworks). “Startups are growing 12-13 percent annually, which is very healthy. The most interesting sector is deep tech which is growing at 50 percent,” NASSCOM President Debjani Ghosh said at the NASSCOM Technology and Leadership Forum 2019 held in Mumbai. Overall, digital is growing at 30 percent and was valued at $33 billion. 2018-19 also saw the highest tech spending in the last five years, according to NASSCOM. “The industry performance showcased a changing narrative for the sector that is focused on internal transformation and driving transformation for its clients globally and in India,” said Rishad Premji, Chairman, NASSCOM.However, despite healthy numbers clocked by the industry in 2018-19, NASSCOM is “cautiously optimistic” about the year ahead, considering multiple macro-economic factors (such as Brexit, Indo-China and Indo-US trade relations, tech regulations, etc.) are at play. Ghosh explained, “There are factors which we cannot control. Tech regulations, for instance, could potentially make or break the industry. We can only look at the things which we can drive… like developing an innovation pipeline, creating R&D hubs, skilling tech talent which is the need of the hour.”",ai

It will look at how AI can be used in health care, education, and agriculture from a public systems delivery perspective.”Policy think-tank NITI Aayog had released a discussion paper in June last year on the “National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence”. It had identified five areas — health care, agriculture, smart cities, education and transportation — that would gain the most from AI. The paper highlighted the barriers to adoption but came under criticism for not providing any roadmap for implementation.The government has been contemplating with the idea of taking help from the technology and already has a smaller centre working on AI under the NIC. It now wants a national centre that could work more with academic institutions to understand how AI can help in governance. “AI can’t grow without data. NIC has two centres — one on AI and one on data analytics. C-DAC has also done phenomenal work on languages. Our interest is to see how this can be used for governance applications,” the senior government official said to Business Standard.",ai

212,"In the 21st century, it is technology that rules the world. With increasing adoption of tech in almost every sphere of life, there are very few sectors that remain untouched. India as a global IT leader has been at the forefront of this revolution, with the integration of technology in areas ranging from farming to governance to banking and even everyday activities like food delivery.Of course, tech adoption hasn’t been equal in all sectors. India’s education sector has always lagged with respects to implementations of latest developments adopted by its global counterparts. But the rise of Edutech startups and focussed government policies in the recent few years seems to be reversing this trend.In fact, there are currently more than 40+ startups; most of them came into existence in the last 5 years that are focussing on EdTech, demonstrating the massive potential for this trend in India.Additionally, with the government looking to implement a massive overhaul of education in Indian with schemes such as RISE (Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education), with a budget of more than Rs 1 lakh crore, the focus is on new age technologies such as cloud computing, AI and VR to enable these changes.",cloud
213,"Data centres in India mainly operate on two models. The first one is known as a captive data centre model, in which an organisation builds, operates, and manages its own data centre. The other is the outsourced or a “co-location “model, where organisations purchases data centre hosting services from external providers. Under this arrangement, the external provider offers power, security and cooling needs for the datacentre, while the customers use the leased space to deploy their servers.Initially, captive data centres enjoyed a significant market share, but gradually, they have ceded their ground to third-party service providers. Third-party data centre service providers are tipping the scales in their favour with their value-added services, innovation, and high opportunity costs of real estate and electricity.As a result, business verticals such as BFSI (banking, financial services, and insurance), telecom, retail, media and entertainment are increasingly leveraging third-party hosting functionalities over in-house data centre services.The Increasing Demand for Data Centre Segments in IndiaStudies show that the Asia Pacific would be the fastest growing region, regarding large data centre segments, over the next five years. Today, APAC accounts for a quarter of the global data centre infrastructure expenditures, at $42 billion.That said, China and India are the two major players set to exploit the market and fuel the growth in the APAC region. The data centre market in India was worth $4.5 billion in 2018 and is likely to reach $7 billion by the year 2020.",dc

215,"In November last year, Google hired ex-Oracle executive Thomas Kurian to lead its cloud business, and the global giant has set some ambitious plans for its cloud business since then. The cloud division which deals with computing services, online data storage and productivity software has ambitiously set a plan to generate more than $1 billion in quarterly revenue, which it had received in the last quarter.The cloud division was earlier led by Diana Greene under whose leadership, the company bowed out from bidding for a $10 billion military cloud computing contract, citing its lack of certifications to handle sensitive data. This was a major blow as it set the company lagging behind its competitors such as Amazon and Microsoft. With Kurian’s onboarding, the company is serious about scaling up its enterprise business across the globe, including India.For Alphabet, the cloud has been able to deliver sizable growth with GCP being one of the fastest growing business. “We’ve doubled the number of GCP contracts greater than $1 million. We’re also seeing an early nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased with the success and penetration there,” Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, was quoted as saying. But unlike market leader Amazon, Google hasn’t specified exactly how much revenue it gets each quarter and Google Cloud still lags behind the cloud market leaders.While Greene was heavily focused on making Google’s ML capabilities and engineering breakthroughs available to customers as a key differentiator, Kurian might tread a different route. Since 2015, when Greene was brought on board, she has done some interesting work in the escalating cloud business. With Kurian’s leadership, the company plans to invest more in sales for its cloud business, and accelerate faster than they have had till date. To achieve this he plans to invest in hiring some of the best talents from around the industry to grow sales organisation.",cloud

217,"Digital demands from businesses arising out of explosion of data and its mandated localization by the government, billions of connected devices, and large-scale cloud adoption by enterprises are giving rise to a new breed of data centres - Hyperscale data centres. To make the most of this trend, India’s leading data centre player, CtrlS, is investing Rs 2000 crore in setting up hyperscale infrastructure claimed to be “the world’s largest Hyperscale Tier-4 data centre facility.”Hyperscale facilities offer mega capacities (such as 50 MW and upwards with ability to collocate 50,000 servers and more) providing a new approach to the way data centres are designed, operated and managed to handle the complexity of new workloads and the increasing demand on IT services.The forces that warrant setting up of Hyperscale data centres are all coalescing. According to Cushman and Wakefield, data is expected to skyrocket from 40,000 Petabyte in 2010 to reach 2.3 million Petabyte in 2020. The global cloud traffic would cross 14.1 Zetabyte (1.2 Zetabyte per month) by the end of 2020, while the IP traffic is expected to cross 2.3 Terabytes by 2020. Ernst and Young predicts that by 2020, there would be 2 billion IoT devices in the country.Besides, the government’s data localization law will further boost the need for Hyperscale data centres.As Sridhar Pinnapureddy founder and CEO at CtrlS Datacenters, says, “Data localization will soon become a reality in the country, which will necessitate most of the businesses to host the data locally in India, be it a bank, insurance, financial services or an ecommerce company – they will now have to comply with the guideline of RBI and Government of India. This is one of the key drivers for Hyperscale data centre growth in India.”According to Cushman and Wakefield, the Indian data centre market, currently estimated at $2 billion, is expected to reach $7 billion by the year 2020. Mirroring this growth, the area under data centres will also shoot up from 10.9 million square feet in 2018 to 30 million square feet in 2025.",cloud

233,"Ateam of Indian American researchers has developed a novel model that uses human inputs to uncover Artificial Intelligence (AI) ""blind spots"" in self-driving cars, so that the vehicles can avoid dangerous errors in the real world. The model developed by MIT and Microsoft researchers identifies instances in which autonomous systems have ""learned"" from training examples that don't match what's actually happening in the real world. Engineers could use this model to improve the safety of AI systems, such as driverless vehicles and autonomous robots.""The model helps autonomous systems better know what they don't know,"" said first author Ramya Ramakrishnan from Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT. ""Many times, when these systems are deployed, their trained simulations don't match the real-world setting [and] they could make mistakes, such as getting into accidents.""The idea is to use humans to bridge that gap between simulation and the real world, in a safe way, so we can reduce some of those errors,"" explained Ramakrishnan. The AI systems powering driverless cars are trained extensively in virtual simulations to prepare the vehicle for nearly every event on the road.But sometimes the car makes an unexpected error in the real world because an event occurs that should, but doesn't, alter the car's behaviour. The researchers validated their method using video games, with a simulated human correcting the learned path of an on-screen character. The next step is to incorporate the model with traditional training and testing approaches for autonomous cars and robots with human feedback.Co-authors on the papers are Julie Shah, an associate professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and head of the CSAIL's Interactive Robotics Group; and Ece Kamar, Debadeepta Dey, and Eric Horvitz -- all from Microsoft Research.

323,"At the dawn of the Information Age in the 1970s, the role of Information Technology (IT) was limited to ‘computing plumbing’ - to keep the networks and computers working. In the 90s and 2000s, it evolved into an enterprise shared servicesmodel that was essential for operational efficiency, cost takeout and decision support.Today, IT is witnessing another shift that increasingly requires the Chief Information Officer organization to act as a partner in defining business strategy and driving topline growth via IT-driven business transformation. To realize this, the IT delivery platform that includes infrastructure, applications, processes and roles of people -needs to be scalable and adaptable tokeep pace with the rapidly changing business and operational needs, and, hence, transform to a hybrid cloud IT architecture.The transformation will involve four phases: Advice for Cloud, Move to Cloud, Build for Cloud and Manage on Cloud. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a fundamental role across all these phases. To understand this better, consider three illustrative scenarios from the Move, Build and Manage phases that are foundational to hybrid cloud adoption across industries: application modernization, DevSecOps and incident analysis and remediation.Modernizing applications for the hybrid cloud.Consider a large retailer with a global supply chain, managed by a complex supply chain application (say, Java-based) that runs on a cluster of machines in the retailer’s data center. The application acts as an integration layer that captures records and serves transactions on their supply chain. Suppose the retailer is looking to evolve its supply chain into a larger ecosystem model where many different service providers, such as warehouse and logistics providers can be easily on-boarded in a largely automated, low-friction manner.However, the application today does not allow for an API-based integration and is architected as a large monolith that would not efficiently scale to support dynamic loads on the system.Since enterprises have many such monolithic applications, they would like to modernize these applications to a scalable and modularized architecture, leveraging microservices and cloud technologies like Red Hat OpenShift, SaaS and IaaS, deployed across a hybrid cloud footprint. However, such modernization can take substantial manual effort, which can easily span over one to two years.",cloud

329,"In the experience economy, we live in a world of ‘Insta-Everything’. Finance platforms have become so effortless and interoperable that it is easy to innovate and disrupt with a simple idea. But are banks catching up? What’s their 2020 game plan going to be?Banks today are under strong pressure to both perform and stay relevant in the market at the same time, thanks to rapid innovations in the sector. Take the introduction of India's very own payments platform, UPI (Unified Payments Interface). It has simplified and democratised payments to such an extent that the entry point for anyone to build a brand-new UPI payments app is very low.While a front-end and user experience can be built, owned, and facilitated by a third-party app like Whatsapp Pay or PhonePe, it is the banks that have to invariably do the heavy lifting for UPI transactions. Contrary to popular belief, QR code scans, VPA verifications, and fund transfers have to be processed by banks instead of the third-party apps to ensure user data security. The third-party apps therefore tie up with sponsor banks (or PSP) to enable this for customers. For example, a user of Whatsapp Pay is ultimately registered with a scheduled Indian bank, immaterial of where his/her bank account is.The UPI effect: Why Indian banks need to up their cloud game in 2020This is a huge problem for banks. On the one hand, they need to act as the middleman to securely forward and route the traffic; on the other hand, they need to process fund transfers in real-time using their core banking systems. Digital transactions using UPI at a local saloon or a pani puri kiosk down the street add to unprecedented transaction volumes that is difficult for banks to size/scale for and plan ahead.",cloud

Technology companies, such as Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services, used their expertise at owning and operating data centers efficiently to rent out computing capacity and software tools to other businesses over the internet.But many businesses that turned to cloud providers still handled at least part of their computing inside their own data centers. This was either for speed reasons - connecting to a cloud data center takes time for data to travel over the internet - or to meet legal or regulatory requirements about where data must be stored.To address those customers, all major cloud providers - including Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc's Google and International Business Machines Corp - offer ""hybrid"" options to make it easier for customers to use cloud technology inside their own data centers.Many of those approaches rely on a business using the cloud provider's software on their own hardware, which limits the number of cloud features offered.Oracle, by contrast, asks for space inside a customer's data center and drops in its own cloud hardware and software, offering all the same services as if Oracle owned the data center, and handling all maintenance. The minimum contract commitment is three years at $500,000 per month.""The customer is buying cloud services and they are providing us space and power and a network connection,"" Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president of engineering, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, said in an interview.

As they are geographically closer to the end user, services are delivered at a faster pace. At times, a single Edge data center may be connected to many other Edge data centers that can be used to store, process and cache data and deliver the required information when needed – at the right time at the right place.So, with Edge computing in place, the need for a centralized data center can be disrupted with an Edge data center, as cloud features are available at the place of operations. While Edge data centers will be providing an array of services independently, a more centralized data center can be backing them up with cloud services and analytics.Why are Edge data centers the next big opportunity?India is increasingly seeing a big opportunity in the business of data centers with three major companies including the Adani Group announcing plans to enter the segment. Also, India is on the path to become one of the biggest global destinations of colocation data center setups where cloud computing architecture facilities can be used by many different companies.

On 20th Feb 2018, Tesla cloud servers were hacked by cryptojackers. The hackers weren’t content just to steal the sensitive data they found, so they also installed some cryptocurrency mining clients during the hijack, Sinha mentioned during the webinar.The IoT technology needs to be secured from hardware and software to network and cloud storage levels. Under Automotive Industry Standard (AIS-140), all the vehicles will be required to have an embedded SIM (eSIM) technology, along with an emergency push button. MCU can be secured to enhance security for connected car solutions, the analyst added.On being asked about the ways by which the operator can help in reducing the challenges, he said system integration is the key for the telecom sector boost via IoT. Rather than focusing upon the deployment of IoT based infrastructure, operators can provide solutions related to smart home utility, livestock monitoring, logistics, and asset tracking. Revenue generated through this means can further be used for hardware deployment, he further added.Analysts had previously told ET that NB-IoT in India specifically lacks in the ecosystem for devices. In order to address the challenge, telcos are taking a partner-led approach to build a complete ecosystem around their NB-IoT networks.",iot

386,"Teradata today announced it is working with Cisco on a digital transformation solution with a focus on smart cities and communities. Combining the merits of Cisco’s IoT platform, Cisco Kinetic for Cities, with the Teradata Analytics Platform, the solution will help cities become smarter and more connected by providing a powerful solution for integrated data exchange. The Cisco Kinetic for Cities platform excels at collecting, aggregating and normalizing real-time data securely across city networks.Teradata is among the first enterprise data analytics companies to integrate with this platform to provide smart data management, such as analytics, persistent data lifecycle management and data enrichment, that delivers business insights to cities and communities. Together, the two leaders in their respective fields provide powerful tools that cities need to improve efficiency, enhance public safety, deliver better citizen services and create new revenue streams.Data collection and management within a city is often decentralized and stored in departmental silos, where each city manager creates a “cockpit” of data and a set of tools for managing specific city facilities. This approach makes it difficult, if not impossible, to generate a city-wide view of the data. Disparate data silos must be integrated to reveal insights about the city as a whole. Only then can the data be used effectively to drive predictive and prescriptive decision-making for a variety of urban services, including lighting, parking, traffic and waste management, citizen engagement, safety and security.Using Cisco Kinetic for Cities, cities can gather, aggregate and normalize information from disparate and siloed city applications, including but not limited to traffic, lighting and parking. Combining this real-time sensor data with other city information, such as data from payment systems, citizen sentiment and analytic applications, Teradata is able to deliver prescriptive and predictive analytics, as well as easy-to-comprehend visualizations, that help city leaders make smarter, more informed decisions. Such a combined solution could, for example, automatically detect security incidents and generate alerts, locate traffic bottlenecks and optimize signals to ease congestion or evaluate route options to shorten emergency vehicle response time.",iot
